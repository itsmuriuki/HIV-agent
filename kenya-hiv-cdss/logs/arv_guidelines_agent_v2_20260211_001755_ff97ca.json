            " \nTB/HIV Co -infection, Prevention and Management  \n8 - 1 \n  \n8. TB/HIV Co -infection, Prevention and \nManagement  \n \nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this \nburden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre -emptive and preventive  treatment \nfor TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in \ncombination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.  \nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquir ing TB, strategies for reducing \nexposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of \ntransmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.  \nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions f or transmission of TB, particularly among \nvulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB \ninfection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors \nand staff.  \n8.1 TB Screenin g for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)  \nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom -based \nTB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; \npatients who screen pos itive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic \npathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for \nTB preventive therapy (TPT).  \nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screenin g among PLHIV, whereas \nActive TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go \nbeyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups \nthat are underserved or at higher risk of  TB are actively reached for providing access to care, \nincluding screening and testing   ",

The screening should utilize a symptom-based approach with specific questions to identify potential TB cases.\n\n2. **Screening Questions**: The recommended questions for screening include:\n   - Cough of any duration\n   - Fever\n   - Noticeable weight loss or failure to thrive\n   - Night sweats\n   - Contact with a TB case\n   \n   If a patient answers \"Yes\" to any of these questions, they should undergo a detailed history, clinical examination, and sputum examination (e.g., sputum smear or GeneXpert). If they answer \"No,\" they should be assessed for eligibility for TB preventive therapy (TPT) and screened again at subsequent visits.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Tests**: For patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases), definitive diagnostic pathways should be followed, which typically involve the use of the GeneXpert Ultra MTB/Rif test as the preferred diagnostic tool. In specific cases, TB-LAM may be used as an adjunct test, particularly for those with advanced HIV disease or severe illness.\n\n4. **Counseling and Prevention**: All PLHIV should receive counseling about the risks associated with TB, strategies for reducing exposure, recognizing symptoms, seeking care promptly, and the importance of TB preventive therapy.\n\n5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous TB screening during each clinic visit is vital, and healthcare settings are encouraged to develop TB infection control guidelines to minimize the risk of TB transmission.\n\nBy adhering to these protocols, the early identification and management of TB among people living with HIV can significantly improve outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality associated with TB co-infection.\n\nReferences: [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][8-1], [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][8-2].",
