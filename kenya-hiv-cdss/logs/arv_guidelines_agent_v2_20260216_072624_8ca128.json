Here are the relevant screening requirements:\n\n1. **Gender-Based Violence (GBV)**: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for experiences of gender-based violence, specifically intimate partner violence (IPV). Appropriate interventions should be offered or clients should be linked to the necessary support services.\n\n2. **Mental Health Assessment**: Psychological factors that may impact adherence to treatment should be evaluated. A basic mental health assessment is critical, and referrals should be made as appropriate to address any identified issues.\n\n3. **HIV Testing for Key and Vulnerable Populations**: All individuals from key populations should receive HIV testing and counseling regardless of their reason for visiting health facilities. This also applies to targeted outreach at key population service delivery points, such as drop-in centers.\n\n4. **Regular Testing**: Key populations that test negative for HIV should undergo retesting every quarter, and immediate referral to treatment and prevention services should be provided for those who test positive.\n\nThese screenings are essential for ensuring comprehensive care and support for those at higher risk due to various demographic factors [HIV Testing Services and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention][23].",
