Fever\n2. Erythematous and/or pruritic rash\n3. Respiratory symptoms (such as shortness of breath, sore throat, or cough)\n4. Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea)\n5. Extreme fatigue or body pain preventing normal activities\n\nIt is crucial that there is **no more likely alternative explanation** for these symptoms for a diagnosis to be made. Symptoms typically worsen within hours after each dose of ABC, and the reaction is considered rare in the Kenyan population, so other diagnoses should always be considered [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][6].\n\n### Management of Abacavir Hypersensitivity Reaction:\nIf a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected or confirmed, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. **Immediate cessation of Abacavir**: The drug must be stopped immediately to avoid further complications and potential fatality.\n2. **Substitute with an alternative antiretroviral (ARV)**: A different ARV regimen should be initiated without delay.\n3. **Education and Alert**: Clearly inform the patient about the nature of the hypersensitivity reaction and ensure they understand the importance of avoiding ABC in the future. Provide an **Adverse Event alert card** that they can carry.\n4. **Never re-challenge**: The patient must never be re-challenged with Abacavir, as even a single dose could result in a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nIt is essential to document this incident appropriately in the patient's medical file [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][6].\n\nFor ongoing care, the healthcare provider should closely monitor the patient for any other potential drug interactions or complications that may affect their HIV treatment regimen.",
