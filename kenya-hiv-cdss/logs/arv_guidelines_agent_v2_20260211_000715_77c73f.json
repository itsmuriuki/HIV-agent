            "  \nAntiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults  \n6 - 3 6.3 First -Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including \nPregnant and Breastfeeding Women)  \nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred \nand alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables  6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis \nare presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.  \nAll patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents \nless than 15 years must have correct weight -based dosing of ARVs conf irmed at every visit.  \nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should \nbe adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including \naddressing anticipated challenges such as dr ug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one \ncaregiver to be informed about a child\u2019s HIV status and receive instruction on administration of \nART.  \nCaregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and \nadminister ARVs.  This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) \nand at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying \na child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day -to-day ART a dministration.  \nTable 6.2: Preferred First -line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and \nAdults 1 \nAge  Weight  Preferred \nRegimen  Dosing2 (correct weight -based dosing must \nbe confirmed at every visit)  \nBirth to 4 \nweeks  Any  AZT + 3TC + NVP3 Refer to Annex 10 for weight -based dosing  \n> 4 weeks to \n< 15 years  < 30 kg  ABC + 3TC + DTG4 Refer to Annex 10 for weight -based dosing  \n\u2265 30 kg  TDF + 3TC + \nDTG5,6 TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once \ndaily  \n\u2265 15 years  Any  TDF + 3TC + \nDTG5,6 TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once \ndaily  \n1 Patients currently on first -line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) \nor alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section \n6.5.1  \n2 See Annex 10 for weight -based dosing of all single -drug and fixed -dose combination formulations  \n3 Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of \nprevious ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as \nthese infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex \n10).
