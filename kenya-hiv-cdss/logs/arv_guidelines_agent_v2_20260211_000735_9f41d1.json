Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the \nsecond -line ART. Add itional drugs may be recommended on a case -by-case basis, including DRV/r, \nATV/r, RAL, or ETR  \n2. Patients failing DTG -based or PI -based first -line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test \n(DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient  summary and DRT results \nshould be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG \n(https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform ) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the \nmost suitable second -line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be us ed to determine if \nthere is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non -adherence. Daily \nwitnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT  \nImportant Considerations for First -line Treatment Failure in Children  \n\u25cf Second -line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and \ntheir caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule \nout inter -current illness or non -adherence as the reason for a high viral load  \n\u25cf All c hildren failing first -line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an \nexperienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second -line. However, this should \nnot cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen  \n\u25cf The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first -line regimen are limited \nand may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of \nthese children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second -line regimen  \nImportant considerations for s econd -line ART Treatment Failure  \n\u25cf Patients failing second -line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third -line \nregimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. \nThese factors will exacerbate pre -existing poor adherence  \n\u25cf Second -line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the \nviral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6)  \no After the first detectable VL ( \uf065 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of \npoor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.  \no These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months \nof excellent adherence (preferably with daily witn essed ingestion of the ARVs by a \ntreatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).  \no If the second VL is still \uf065 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second -line regimen \nwhile reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence \nsupport systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.  \no If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza \nHotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform ) using the national \ncase summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for \nthe TWG to design the most suitable third -line regimen  \n\u25cf Patients failing second -line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence \nand ongoing enhanced adherence support including  \no Assigning a case manager  \no More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor  \no Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders  \no Provision of adherence support such as modified directly observed therapy, a \ntreatment supporter, hom e visits etc.  ",

Syphilis elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeed ing Women and Infant \nTreatment  \nThe country has adopted triple elimination of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B among pregnant and \nbreastfeeding women. It is recommended that all pregnant women attending ANC and not aware \nof their HIV status require a dual HIV syphilis test during their first trimester and a second HIV \nSyphilis test in the 3rd trimester if the initial test was negative.   \nAll women who test positive for syphilis at any point during pregnancy and breastfeeding should \nbe treated with the appropria te regimen. (Table 7.3). All babies born of mothers who test positive \nfor syphilis are suspected to be exposed to syphilis and should also be treated with the correct \nregimen (Table 7.3). Ensure to perform contact tracing for all the sexual contacts and en sure they \nare treated for syphilis.  \nSymptoms of congenital syphilis may not become apparent for several weeks or months after \nbirth.  \n7.3. Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant \nProphylaxis  \nRequires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for \ntheir own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral \nhepatitis B.  \nRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as  part of the ANC \nprofile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B & C which pose a big risk to both the mother and \nfetus.  \nFor pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate \ntreatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also \nacts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child. All pregnant and breastfeeding \nwomen without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against \nhepatitis B. (Chapter 9).  \nHIV positive infants without evidence of infection should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B.  \nInfants born of mothers who test positive for HBsAG should be treated using Hepatitis B \nImmunoglobulin (Table 7.3).  \nRefer to Chapter 9 f or management of HIV/HBV coinfection.  \n \n  ",

Here, I'll explain two important methodologies: **Drug Resistance Testing** and **Early Infant Diagnosis** (EID).\n\n### Drug Resistance Testing (DRT)\nDrug Resistance Testing is particularly important for patients who experience treatment failure on antiretroviral therapy (ART). According to the Kenyan guidelines:\n\n1. **Indications for DRT**: \n   - DRT should be ordered when a patient fails a first-line regimen that is based on Dolutegravir (DTG) or a Protease Inhibitor (PI). This is crucial for determining the most suitable second-line ART.\n   - The results help distinguish between true drug resistance and issues related to non-adherence.\n\n2. **Procedure**: \n   - Upon confirming treatment failure, a drug resistance test is performed, and the results are discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical Technical Working Group (TWG) to tailor the second-line regimen effectively.\n   - It's suggested that patients have witnessed ingestion of their medications prior to testing to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Considerations**:\n   - For pediatric cases, treatment choices may be limited, and consultation with experienced ART providers is recommended to manage second-line therapies appropriately.\n\nThis approach ensures that treatment is personalized based on the patient's specific resistance patterns, leading to better outcomes [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][6-20].\n\n### Early Infant Diagnosis (EID)\nEarly Infant Diagnosis refers to the testing of newborns for HIV infection, which is crucial for timely initiation of ART. Key points about EID include:\n\n1. **Birth Testing**: \n   - Infants born to HIV-positive mothers should undergo HIV testing with a DNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) as soon as possible after birth, ideally within the first two weeks. \n   - It is recommended to initiate ART immediately for infants who test positive to prevent disease progression.\n\n2. **Follow-Up Testing**:\n   - All HIV-exposed infants should have a DNA PCR test by six weeks of age, and if negative, additional tests at six months and twelve months are also required to confirm the absence of HIV infection.\n   - An antibody test is mandated at 18 months and every six months thereafter during breastfeeding until cessation of breastfeeding.\n\n3. **High-Risk Infants**: \n   - Infants born to mothers at high risk of spreading HIV (e.g., unsuppressed viral load) should be prioritized for birth testing to rapidly start treatment if necessary.\n\nEID helps to identify HIV-positive infants early on, allowing for immediate ART initiation, which is key to improving survival rates and health outcomes [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][2-10] and [2-8].\n\n### Summary\nBoth drug resistance testing and early infant diagnosis are critical components of effective HIV management. They enable healthcare providers to tailor treatments based on individual needs, ultimately improving patient outcomes in the HIV care continuum.",
