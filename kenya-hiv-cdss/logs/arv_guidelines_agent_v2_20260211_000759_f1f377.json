For patients wit h HBV co -infection, the benefit of TDF or TAF for treating \nHBV often outweighs the risks of renal impairment, so more severe levels of renal impairment are \ntolerated. See Table 9.3 for TDF and TAF dose adjustments for patients with HBV/HIV co -infection. \nThese patients should be managed in consultation with an experienced clinician  \n\u25cf If HBV negative and on first line ART, substitute TDF with ABC, TAF or DTG + 3TC dual therapy, \nfollowing the single drug substitution algorithm (Figure 6.4).

          "content": "### Creatinine Clearance Calculation\n\nCreatinine clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using various formulas, one common method is using the following formula for adults:\n\n\\[ \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times \\text{weight (kg)}}{72 \\times \\text{serum creatinine (mg/dL)}} \\]\n\nFor women, the result should be multiplied by 0.85. Additionally, for children and adolescents, the formula incorporates height and uses different constants. For example, the equation can be organized as:\n\n\\[ \\text{eGFR} = k \\times \\text{height (cm)} / \\text{serum creatinine (mg/dL)} \\]\n- Where \\( k = 0.45 \\) for infants < 1 year, \\( k = 0.55 \\) for children (1 \u2013 10 years), \\( k = 0.55 \\) for female adolescents (11-19 years), and \\( k = 0.70 \\) for male adolescents (11-19 years) [Annex 15][55].\n\n### Implications of Using Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF)\n\nThe use of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) in patients with varying levels of renal function must be approached with caution due to its potential nephrotoxic effects:\n\n- **CrCl \u2265 90 ml/min**: TDF can be given at the standard dose of 300 mg once daily. Monitor renal function at baseline and then at 1 month, 3 months, and biannually thereafter if stable.\n  \n- **CrCl 50 - 89 ml/min**: TDF 300 mg can still be administered once daily, but closer monitoring for renal function decline is necessary (monthly during the first year and every three months thereafter if stable).\n\n- **CrCl 30 - 49 ml/min**: Use of TDF should generally be avoided unless no suitable alternative exists; if TDF is used, decrease the dosing frequency to every 48 hours and monitor closely with monthly CrCl for the first year [Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults][13].\n\n- **CrCl < 30 ml/min**: TDF should be avoided unless there are specific circumstances, such as HIV/HBV co-infection. If TDF is necessary in such cases, it may be given 300 mg every 72 hours, with careful monitoring of renal function [Standard Package of Care for PLHIV][23].\n\nAdditionally, for patients with HBV co-infection, while the risk of renal impairment is higher, the potential benefits of using TDF for managing hepatitis B might outweigh the risks; however, these patients should be managed in consultation with a specialist [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][6]. \n\nThus, it is essential to monitor renal function regularly and adjust TDF dosing based on CrCl to avoid potential complications associated with renal toxicity.",
