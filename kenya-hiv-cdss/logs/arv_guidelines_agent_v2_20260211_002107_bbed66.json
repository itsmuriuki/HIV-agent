Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and \nSupport  \n \nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the \nprescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow -up plans. Adherence -\nenhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV di agnosis (as part of \npost -test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the \nentire follow -up period for ART.  \n \nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have \nan adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual \nbarriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. \nThis is particularly important with the current recommendation t hat all PLHIV qualify for ART, \nand ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at \ntime of HIV testing, and close follow -up is required after ART initiation.  \n \nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to \ntheir level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow -up stage that they are at (Figure \n5.1).  \n \nWhenever possible, follow -up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care \nproviders (e.g ., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important \nduring the first few months of HIV care.  \n  ",
