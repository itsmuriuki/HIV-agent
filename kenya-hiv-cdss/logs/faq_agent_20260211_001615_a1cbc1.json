Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to \nschedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV \nclinic for unscheduled appointment whenever  an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at \nanother facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification , every \nappointment should include:  \n\u2212 Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)  \n\u2212 Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication  \n\u2212  Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling \non the same  \n3 Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent \nmonthly appointments until month 6.  \n4 All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and \nwithin 2 weeks. For patients who do not  start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, \nthey should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are \ndelaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment \npreparation and ART r eadiness assessment.  \n4Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.  \n5children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, \nwith weight -based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.  \nIn adults, weig ht and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status \nand calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.  \n6The first 2 -4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managi ng adverse \ndrug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at \nevery contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and \nsupport procedures for each visit  \nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre -\nrequisite for ART initiation.  \nTargeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter -current diseases or \nadverse drug reactions.  \n3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/ breastfeeding \nWomen  \nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique \nchallenges in retention  and viral suppression and  hence may benefit more from different iated \nservice delivery models  adapted to their needs.  \nChildren:  Children\u2019s care is dependent on family and care giver dynamics. Family centered \napproaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, \nshould be used.  A ssessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be \nconducted for pairs and follow -up tailored to their situations. Weight -based dose adjustments \nshould be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable  weighing \nscales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review.  Aligning \nappointments with school calendar should be considered to avert disruption of treatment and \nlearning of the child.  ",
            "  \nAntiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults  \n6 - 1  \n6. Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, \nAdolescents, and Adults  \nART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is \nto suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the  patient\u2019s VL to undetectable levels. \nUninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels \nthereby preventing damage to the body\u2019s immune system, reducing AIDS -related morbidity and \nmortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.  \n6.1 Eligibility for ART  \nAll individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 \ncount, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co -infection status, \nrisk group, or any other cri teria.  \n6.2 Timing of ART Initiation  \nART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of \nconfirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.  \nART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be \naddressed around the time of ART initiation. Same -day ART initiation (on the same day as testing \nHIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfee ding \nwomen, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with \nimproved retention, viral suppression, and survival. Special considerations for timing of ART \ninitiation are listed in Table 6.1.  \n  ",
            "  \nAdherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support  \n5 - 1  \n5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and \nSupport  \n \nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the \nprescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow -up plans. Adherence -\nenhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV di agnosis (as part of \npost -test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the \nentire follow -up period for ART.  \n \nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have \nan adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual \nbarriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. \nThis is particularly important with the current recommendation t hat all PLHIV qualify for ART, \nand ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at \ntime of HIV testing, and close follow -up is required after ART initiation.  \n \nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to \ntheir level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow -up stage that they are at (Figure \n5.1).  \n \nWhenever possible, follow -up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care \nproviders (e.g ., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important \nduring the first few months of HIV care.  \n  ",

This approach has benefits for HIV prevention and is associated with better retention in care, viral suppression, and overall survival.\n\n- **Within 2 Weeks**: For those not starting on the same day, ART should be started within **two weeks** of the diagnosis.\n\n- **Continuous Support**: After a patient is diagnosed, they should be followed up closely (weekly if necessary) until ART is initiated to address any barriers that might delay treatment.\n\nIn summary, the recommendation is to begin ART as soon as possible, ideally within 2 weeks of diagnosis, with the possibility of same-day initiation for eligible patients.",
