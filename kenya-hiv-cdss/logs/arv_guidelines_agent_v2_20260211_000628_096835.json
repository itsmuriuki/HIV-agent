          "content": "During a session focused on advanced adherence strategies, the review of an adherence plan should include the following key components:\n\n1. **Adherence Monitoring**: Employ tools such as the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) for self-reported adherence assessment. This should be done during every visit, as needed, to guide adherence discussions and interventions. Adherence can be categorized as good, inadequate, or poor based on the score, and appropriate actions should be taken based on these categories [5 - 23].\n\n2. **Objective Measures**:\n   - **Pill Counts**: Patients should bring all pills to follow-up visits. Compare the expected number of remaining pills with the actual count to assess missed doses. This should be done at every visit until the patient\u2019s viral load is confirmed as suppressed [5 - 21].\n   - **Pharmacy Refill Records**: Track drug pick-up dates against expected refill schedules, identifying potential missed doses via late pickups [5 - 21].\n\n3. **Viral Load Monitoring**: Use viral load results as an objective measure of adherence. An undetectable viral load is indicative of good adherence. The schedule for viral load testing should follow specified guidelines according to the patient's age and circumstances (e.g., pregnant or breastfeeding women) [5 - 21].\n\n4. **Barriers to Adherence**: Identify and assess any barriers that could affect adherence during these sessions. This could include psychosocial factors, side effects of treatment, or other health-related issues. A multidisciplinary team approach should be utilized when discussing and addressing these barriers [5 - 11, 5 - 25].\n\n5. **Counseling and Support Interventions**: Evaluate the effectiveness of counseling and support interventions previously provided, noting any changes or needs for further support. This includes reviewing the involvement of treatment supporters and any home visits conducted for adherence monitoring [5 - 25].\n\n6. **Progress and Engagement Strategies**: Discuss the patient's engagement with their treatment plan, support systems in place, and their participation in any HIV education or support groups. This assessment helps identify what additional support might be needed to enhance adherence [5 - 11].\n\nAddressing these components during the review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the patient\u2019s adherence status and allow for tailored interventions to improve their treatment outcomes. \n\nReferences:\n- [Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support][5 - 21]\n- [Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support][5 - 23]\n- [Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support][5 - 11]\n- [Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support][5 - 25]",
