Here are the key screening modalities recommended by the Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines:\n\n1. **General Populations and Vulnerable Groups:**\n   - All individuals accessing HIV services should undergo risk assessments to determine their eligibility for HIV testing. This includes identifying individuals with multiple sexual partners or known HIV exposures, such as sexual or needle-sharing partners of people living with HIV [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][2].\n\n2. **Gender-Based Screening:**\n   - Clients accessing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be screened for gender-based violence (GBV), particularly intimate partner violence (IPV), with appropriate interventions offered if needed [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][23].\n\n3. **Mental Health Assessment:**\n   - Psychological assessments should be conducted to address any mental health issues that might affect adherence to treatment. This involves basic evaluations and referrals when necessary [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][23].\n\n4. **Screening for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):**\n   - All people living with HIV (PLHIV) should be screened annually for hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and renal disease. Routine cancer screenings (for cervical, breast, bowel, and prostate cancers) should also be provided [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][23].\n\n5. **Reproductive Health Services for Women:**\n   - Women of reproductive age should be screened for pregnancy status and contraception needs. Additionally, HIV-positive women aged 18-65 should annually undergo cervical cancer screening using HPV testing or visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][23].\n\nThese guidelines emphasize tailored screening approaches based on demographic risk factors, highlighting the need for comprehensive and sensitive health assessments in various populations.",
