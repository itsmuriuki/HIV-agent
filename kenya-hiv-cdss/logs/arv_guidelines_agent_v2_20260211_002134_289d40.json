The metabolism of CCBs can be inhibited by PIs, which may lead to an increased antihypertensive effect. Consequently, a lower starting dose of CCBs may be required, and careful monitoring for excessive reduction in blood pressure is recommended.\n\nThis interaction applies to various CCBs, including nifedipine, amlodipine, and felodipine, and is relevant for all PIs [Annex 13 B][49]. \n\nIn summary:\n- **Effect**: Increased antihypertensive effect of CCBs.\n- **Recommendation**: Use a lower starting dose and monitor blood pressure closely.\n\nPlease ensure to adhere to these guidelines for optimal patient safety and efficacy.",
