Preferred \nand alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables  6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis \nare presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.  \nAll patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents \nless than 15 years must have correct weight -based dosing of ARVs conf irmed at every visit.  \nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should \nbe adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including \naddressing anticipated challenges such as dr ug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one \ncaregiver to be informed about a child\u2019s HIV status and receive instruction on administration of \nART.  \nCaregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and \nadminister ARVs.  This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) \nand at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying \na child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day -to-day ART a dministration.  \nTable 6.2: Preferred First -line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and \nAdults 1 \nAge  Weight  Preferred \nRegimen  Dosing2 (correct weight -based dosing must \nbe confirmed at every visit)  \nBirth to 4 \nweeks  Any  AZT + 3TC + NVP3 Refer to Annex 10 for weight -based dosing  \n> 4 weeks to \n< 15 years  < 30 kg  ABC + 3TC + DTG4 Refer to Annex 10 for weight -based dosing  \n\u2265 30 kg  TDF + 3TC + \nDTG5,6 TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once \ndaily  \n\u2265 15 years  Any  TDF + 3TC + \nDTG5,6 TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once \ndaily  \n1 Patients currently on first -line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) \nor alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section \n6.5.1  \n2 See Annex 10 for weight -based dosing of all single -drug and fixed -dose combination formulations  \n3 Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of \nprevious ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as \nthese infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex \n10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, \nulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre -term infants  \n4 Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per \nFigure 6.2  \n5 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed -dose combinations are available  \n6 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV -negative pa tients once fixed -dose combinations \nare available  \n \n  ",
            "  \nAntiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults  \n6 - 7 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART  \nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter -\ncurrent illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to \ntreatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, \nadditional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a \nlaboratory test result may alter patient management.  \nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral \nload, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug -drug interactions, co -morbidities and \ntreatment failure.  \n6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line \nART  \nPatients who are virally suppressed o n first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even \nif they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug -drug interactions requiring a \nchange. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and \nadolescen ts <15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long -term toxicity and improve cost -\neffectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to \nefavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for  children, adolescents and \nadults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG -containing regimen, proactive \nswitching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible \ndolutegravir tablet.  \nChildren and adolesc ents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the \nrecommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as \nper Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band.  This also \nincludes PL HIV who recently initiated non -standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the \nfirst VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the \npatient/caregiver.  \nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV,  particularly \nside effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the \nnew ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1 -2 weeks.  ",
            "  \nAntiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults  \n6 - 1  \n6. Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, \nAdolescents, and Adults  \nART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is \nto suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the  patient\u2019s VL to undetectable levels. \nUninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels \nthereby preventing damage to the body\u2019s immune system, reducing AIDS -related morbidity and \nmortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.  \n6.1 Eligibility for ART  \nAll individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 \ncount, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co -infection status, \nrisk group, or any other cri teria.  \n6.2 Timing of ART Initiation  \nART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of \nconfirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.  \nART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be \naddressed around the time of ART initiation. Same -day ART initiation (on the same day as testing \nHIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfee ding \nwomen, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with \nimproved retention, viral suppression, and survival. Special considerations for timing of ART \ninitiation are listed in Table 6.1.  \n  ",
