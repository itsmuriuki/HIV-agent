Summary of Key Recommendations  \n \n1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention  \n\u2022 HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where \nConsent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating \nan enabling environment can be assured  \n\u2022 To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:  \n\u25aa Facility -based  \n\u25aa Community -based  \n\u2022 Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV \nself-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as \neligible for testing  \n\u2022 Serial testing, using ap proved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV \ninfection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV -positive \ndiagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays  \n \n1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow -up for PLHIV  \n\u25cf Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:  \n\u25aa Baseline investigation for all PLHIV  \n\u25aa Any patient with suspected treatment failure  \n\u25aa Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for > 3 months  \n\u25aa Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to \ndetermine when prophylaxis can be discontinued  \n\u25cf Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:  \n\u25aa Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of \nless than 200 cells/mm3 or \n\u25aa WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease  \n\u25aa All children younger than five years  \n\u25cf All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of \ncare that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophyl axis, and \nmanagement  of opportunistic infections.  \n\u25cf Frequency of routine VL monitoring:  \n\u25aa For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)  \n\u25aa Age 0 -24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months  \n\u25aa Age \u2265 25 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, then at month 12, and then annually  ",
            "  \nAdherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support  \n5 - 31 5.5.1 Enhanced Adherence Assessments  \nAs soon as treatment failure is suspected the patient/caregiver should be discussed by the facility \nmulti -disciplinary team to develop a plan for assessing barriers to adherence (includin g \nscheduling a home visit), and assessing other potential causes of treatment failure (e.g., \ninadequate dosing/dose adjustments, drug -drug interactions, drug -food interactions, impaired \nabsorption e.g., chronic severe diarrhoea).  \nAll patients with suspecte d or confirmed treatment failure should have a thorough assessment of \npotential barriers to adherence (Table 5.15).  \nIf the patient has a caregiver, treatment buddy, and/or spouse/partner who is enrolled in HIV \ncare, that person\u2019s file should also be review ed to confirm their most recent viral load results and \nadherence.  \n5.5.2 Enhanced Adherence Counselling  \nAdherence assessment and enhanced adherence counselling should begin as soon as a detectable \nviral load ( \u2265 200 copies/ml) is received, preferably within 2 weeks.  \nThe goal of Enhanced Adherence Counselling is to assess possible barriers to adherence in a non -\njudgmental way and to help the patient construct an adherence plan with concrete objectives. It \nis important not to focus solely on k nowledge of HIV and ART but also to review psychological, \nemotional, and socio -economic factors that may contribute to poor adherence. In addition, \nexploring the patient\u2019s motivation for taking medication often highlights reasons for poor \nadherence.  \nAt lea st three sessions of Enhanced Adherence Counselling, spaced 2 -4 weeks apart, are \nrecommended as the minimum number of sessions, but additional sessions can be added as \nneeded (Table 5.1 8). If the adherence is evaluated as adequate, a repeat viral load is d one after \nthree months of excellent adherence, and another Enhanced Adherence Counselling session is \nconducted to discuss the viral load results. A detailed content guide for Enhanced Adherence \nCounselling is provided in Annex 9.  \nIt is preferable to have t he patient go through all adherence counselling sessions with the same \ncounsellor in order to provide continuity, and that the session is documented to ensure follow -up \nof all issues identified.  \nIf adequate adherence cannot be achieved then consult with a senior clinician, discuss as an MDT, \nor consult the Regional or National TWG.  \n  ",

          "content": "Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in HIV programs are essential for several reasons:\n\n1. **Quality Assurance**: M&E provides a framework to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of HIV programs. It ensures that services meet established standards and can lead to improved patient outcomes.\n\n2. **Outcome Measurement**: By tracking specific outcomes, healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns in treatment success, adherence rates, and overall health of persons living with HIV (PLHIV). This is crucial for adjusting strategies and ensuring that interventions are effective.\n\n3. **Resource Allocation**: M&E helps in determining where resources are best invested based on the performance of different programs or strategies. This leads to improved program sustainability and effectiveness.\n\n4. **Identifying Gaps**: Monitoring helps to identify gaps in service delivery and areas where PLHIV may be underserved. It can highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve care.\n\n5. **Policy Formulation**: Evaluation results can guide policymakers in making informed decisions about future health strategies and interventions.\n\nKey outcomes that should be focused on during monitoring and evaluation in HIV programs include:\n\n- **Viral Load Suppression**: Tracking the percentage of patients achieving a suppressed viral load (<200 copies/ml) is critical for assessing treatment efficacy.\n\n- **Adherence Rates**: Monitoring and supporting adherence to the antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen is vital, as it directly impacts treatment success and viral load suppression.\n\n- **Linkage to Care**: Evaluating the percentage of HIV-positive individuals who are linked to care after diagnosis is essential for ensuring prompt treatment initiation.\n\n- **Retention in Care**: Assessing the retention rates of patients in ongoing care is important to reduce loss to follow-up.\n\n- **Health Outcomes**: Monitoring overall health outcomes such as CD4 counts and incidence of opportunistic infections can provide insight into the effectiveness of the care provided.\n\n- **Behavioral Outcomes**: Evaluation of risk behaviors in PLHIV and their partners can help in refining prevention strategies and educational efforts.\n\nThese monitoring and evaluation efforts allow for continuous improvement in the response to the HIV epidemic in Kenya[KENYA HIV PREVENTION AND TREATMENT GUIDELINES, 2022][PAGE 4-5].",
