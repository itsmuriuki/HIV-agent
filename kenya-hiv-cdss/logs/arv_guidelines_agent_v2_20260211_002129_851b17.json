Common gastrointestinal issues include:\n\n1. **Nausea**\n2. **Diarrhea**\n3. **Abdominal pain**\n4. **Loss of appetite**\n\n### Management of Gastrointestinal Side Effects:\n\n- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up assessments are crucial, particularly during the first month after initiating PrEP. During these visits, healthcare providers should inquire about any side effects the patient may be experiencing.\n  \n- **Reassurance**: Many mild gastrointestinal side effects tend to improve over time as the body adjusts to the medication. Patients should be reassured if they report minor GI symptoms.\n\n- **Supportive Care**: For more severe symptoms, supportive measures can include dietary adjustments (like eating smaller, more frequent meals) and hydration support. \n\n- **Further Evaluation**: If symptoms persist or are severe, further evaluation may be necessary to rule out other causes or consider switching medications.\n\nPatients should be informed about potential side effects before starting PrEP, and they should know when to seek clinical advice if they experience bothersome symptoms. \n\nOverall, effective communication and supportive management can help patients adhere to PrEP while minimizing discomfort from gastrointestinal side effects [Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)][11-5].",
