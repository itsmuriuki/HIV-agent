Close monitoring during this period helps ensure that patients adhere to their regimen, leading to effective viral load reduction and lowering the risk of transmission.\n\n2. **Rapid ART Initiation**: Given the recommendation that ART be initiated within two weeks of diagnosis, there is an urgency to ensure good adherence from the start. Effective adherence strategies must be in place to support patients as they begin therapy, addressing any common or individual barriers to adherence.\n\n3. **Preventing Treatment Failure**: High levels of adherence are necessary to avoid treatment failure, which could necessitate a switch to more complex second or third-line regimens. Early adherence issues can lead to resistance or a lack of response to therapy if not managed promptly.\n\n4. **Counselling and Support**: Intensive counselling and support during these initial months are vital. This may involve engaging treatment supporters and tailored strategies to address any barriers to adherence the patient may face.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-Up**: Frequent follow-up during this time helps healthcare providers monitor any issues that may arise and adjust support accordingly, ensuring that the patient's experience is positive and that they receive the necessary encouragement and assistance to maintain adherence.\n\nOverall, these factors underscore the importance of adherence monitoring in the first months of ART to ensure successful treatment outcomes and long-term health for people living with HIV [Kenya ARV Guidelines][5].",
