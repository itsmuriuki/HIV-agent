Walking independently and with good balance.\n2. Running with improved coordination and speed.\n3. Climbing onto and down from furniture without assistance.\n4. Jumping in place and possibly forward.\n5. Kicking a ball forward.\n6. Throwing a ball overhand.\n7. Beginning to ride a tricycle or similar push toys.\n\nThese milestones can vary from child to child, and it's important to consider that children develop skills at their own pace. If there are concerns about a child's development, it may be beneficial to consult a pediatrician or child development specialist.",
