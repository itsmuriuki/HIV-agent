Lack of immediate availability of HIV DNA PCR results \nfor confirmation of HIV could result in undue delay in starting life -saving ART. In such children, a \npresumptive diagnosis of HIV infection can be made using the criteria in Table 2.3. A RT can be \ninitiated while awaiting HIV DNA PCR results to confirm HIV infection.  \nTable 2.3: Presumptive Diagnosis of HIV in children <18 months while awaiting DNA PCR \nResults  \nHIV antibody test positive AND symptomatic with;  \n 2 or more of the following:  \n\u25cf Oral candidiasis/thrush  \n\u25cf Severe pneumonia  \n\u25cf Severe sepsis  \nOR any of the of following:  \n\u25cf Any WHO Clinical Stage 4 condition  \n\u25cf Recent maternal death (if likely to have been HIV -related) or advanced HIV disease in \nmother  \n\u25cf Child\u2019s CD4% < 2 5% \n \n2.4.1.2  Birth Testing  \nBirth testing is defined as HIV testing (with DNA PCR) at birth or around birth for infants born to \nHIV-positive mothers. Birth testing has the potential to improve survival for infants who are \ninfected during pregnancy, around labour and delivery by ident ifying them early for rapid ART \ninitiation. Do not use cord blood for birth testing as this could result in false positive results.  \nA DNA PCR test can be offered at birth or around birth where feasible.  \nALL children initially tested at birth should be rete sted at 6 weeks of age and the EID \nalgorithm followed (Figure 2.2.)  \nConsiderations for providing birth testing:  \nBirth testing may be prioritized for newborns who are at high risk of HIV acquisition including \nthose born to:  \n\u25cf Mothers who seroconvert during p regnancy.  \n\u25cf Mothers who have unsuppressed or unknown viral loads during delivery.  \n\u25cf Mothers who received a HIV positive diagnosis for the first time at or after 28 weeks \ngestation or during labour and delivery  \n\u25cf Mother on ART for less than 12 weeks prior to delivery  \nBirth testing should be offered where this is feasible:  \n\u25cf DNA PCR results can be returned the same  day e.g., where on site point of care is available.  \n\u25cf ART regimens recommended for neonates as per national guidelines are available and can \nbe initiated immed iately.  \n\u25cf Follow -up of the newborn is done to ensure no lost to follow -up.

If the test is negative, it should be repeated every 6 months until cessation of breastfeeding.\n   - For mothers at high risk of HIV infection (e.g., key populations, those in HIV discordant relationships, or having multiple sexual partners), retesting postpartum should occur every 3 months.\n\n4. **Counseling and Education**: Pregnant and breastfeeding women should receive education on the schedule for repeat HIV testing, and those who do not test during initial contact should be offered counseling and testing in subsequent visits.\n\n5. **Support for HIV Positive Women**: All HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women enrolled in care should receive comprehensive support, including counseling, case management, and linkage to preventive services for themselves and their partners.\n\n6. **Testing for Partners**: All spouses/partners and children of pregnant and breastfeeding women who test HIV positive should be offered HIV testing and counseling [Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022][2-4, 7-2].\n\nThese recommendations ensure that pregnant women are adequately screened for both HIV and STIs, with a focus on timely testing and support.",
