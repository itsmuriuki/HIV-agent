Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to \nschedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV \nclinic for unscheduled appointment whenever  an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at \nanother facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification , every \nappointment should include:  \n\u2212 Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)  \n\u2212 Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication  \n\u2212  Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling \non the same  \n3 Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent \nmonthly appointments until month 6.  \n4 All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and \nwithin 2 weeks. For patients who do not  start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, \nthey should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are \ndelaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment \npreparation and ART r eadiness assessment.  \n4Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.  \n5children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, \nwith weight -based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.  \nIn adults, weig ht and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status \nand calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.  \n6The first 2 -4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managi ng adverse \ndrug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at \nevery contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and \nsupport procedures for each visit  \nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre -\nrequisite for ART initiation.  \nTargeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter -current diseases or \nadverse drug reactions.  \n3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/ breastfeeding \nWomen  \nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique \nchallenges in retention  and viral suppression and  hence may benefit more from different iated \nservice delivery models  adapted to their needs.  \nChildren:  Children\u2019s care is dependent on family and care giver dynamics. Family centered \napproaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, \nshould be used.  A ssessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be \nconducted for pairs and follow -up tailored to their situations. Weight -based dose adjustments \nshould be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable  weighing \nscales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review.  Aligning \nappointments with school calendar should be considered to avert disruption of treatment and \nlearning of the child.  ",
            "  \nKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022  \n5 - 22 Table 5:10 Cont.  \n \n \nHome visit  Observe where and how a patient stores and takes \ntheir medications and assess if they have extra \nmedications because of missed doses. Home visits \nmay also provide a better understanding of a \npatient\u2019s living situation and specific barriers to \nadherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more \nrevealing, but should only be conducted if the  patient \nconsente d to home visits previously (preferably at \nthe time of enrolment or initiation)  For patients with suspected or \nconfirmed treatment failure, \npatients who default from care, \nor any time the MDT feels a \nhome visit will contribute to \npatient management  \n \nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non -\njudgmental relationship with patients.  This is best done when one provider follows an \nindividual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the \nspecifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in \nan open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they \nbelieve the clinician wants to hear: perfe ct adherence.  \nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in \nassessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients \nwho do not have significant barriers to adherence . However, patients with significant adherence \nchallenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional \ntraining and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving \nexperienced colleagu es at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is \nidentified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as \npossible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be require d \nfor complex situations.  \n  ",

This allows for easy tracking of attendance.\n\n2. **Patient Follow-Up Register**: All patients who miss their scheduled appointments should be recorded in a patient follow-up register. This register will help in documenting those who did not attend.\n\n3. **Immediate Contact**: Patients who miss an appointment should be contacted within 24 hours. This could involve calling the patient directly, and if there is no response, contacting a treatment buddy or caregiver.\n\n4. **Multiple Follow-Up Attempts**: Several attempts should be made to reach patients by phone, especially if the initial contact is unsuccessful. This ensures that every effort is made to support the patient.\n\n5. **Update Records**: Document the outcomes of these follow-up contacts in the patient follow-up register, which helps in tracking the patient's status.\n\n6. **Assess Barriers to Adherence**: For patients who return, it's important to assess any potential barriers to adherence and provide necessary support. This can involve reviewing the patient's knowledge about HIV care, addressing concerns, and exploring life changes that may impact their adherence.\n\n7. **Home Visits**: In certain cases, particularly for high-risk patients (e.g., pregnant women, children), prioritizing home visits may help in obtaining a deeper understanding of the patient's circumstances and barriers to care.\n\n8. **Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) Discussion**: If patients cannot be traced or do not return to the clinic, the case should be discussed by the MDT to develop a follow-up management plan.\n\nBy implementing such measures, healthcare providers can effectively manage default patients and minimize the risks associated with missed appointments and interruptions in care. \n\nFor the specific recommendation details, please refer to the Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022 [5 - 35].",
