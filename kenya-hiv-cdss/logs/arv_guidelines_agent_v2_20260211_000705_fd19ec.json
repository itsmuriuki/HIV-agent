This is particularly \nimportant during the first 3 months in care  \n\u2022 For all children/adol escents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. \nOngoing care should include a plan for age -appropriate disclosure  \n\u2022 All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence \nmonitoring, counselling and support s hould continue despite viral suppression  \n\u2022 Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or \nPrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and \nfor taking action within 24 hours of a mi ssed appointment  \n\u2022 In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure \nhave been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case -\nmanagement approach)  \n1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults  \n\u2022 The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient\u2019s VL \nto undetectable levels (Viral Load <50 copies/LD L) \n\u2022 All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 \ncount/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co -infection status, \nrisk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start \nART  \n\u2022 ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the  same day as \nconfirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks)  \n\u2022 Preferred first -line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults  \n\u25aa Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP  \n\u25aa > 4 weeks to < 15 years old  \n\u25aa < 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG  \n\u25aa \u2265 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG  \n\u25aa \u2265 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG  \n\u2022 Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first -\nline ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred \nregimen  \n\u2022 Treatment failure is suspected when a pa tient has a VL \u2265 100 0 copies/ml after at least 3 \nmonths of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is \u2265 1,000 copies/ml \nafter assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then \nrepeating VL after at least 3 mo nths of excellent adherence to allow for viral re -\nsuppression  ",
            "  \nSummary of Key Recommendations  \n1 - 1   \n1. Summary of Key Recommendations  \n \n1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention  \n\u2022 HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where \nConsent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating \nan enabling environment can be assured  \n\u2022 To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:  \n\u25aa Facility -based  \n\u25aa Community -based  \n\u2022 Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV \nself-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as \neligible for testing  \n\u2022 Serial testing, using ap proved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV \ninfection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV -positive \ndiagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays  \n \n1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow -up for PLHIV  \n\u25cf Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:  \n\u25aa Baseline investigation for all PLHIV  \n\u25aa Any patient with suspected treatment failure  \n\u25aa Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for > 3 months  \n\u25aa Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to \ndetermine when prophylaxis can be discontinued  \n\u25cf Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:  \n\u25aa Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of \nless than 200 cells/mm3 or \n\u25aa WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease  \n\u25aa All children younger than five years  \n\u25cf All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of \ncare that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophyl axis, and \nmanagement  of opportunistic infections.  \n\u25cf Frequency of routine VL monitoring:  \n\u25aa For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)  \n\u25aa Age 0 -24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months  \n\u25aa Age \u2265 25 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, then at month 12, and then annually  ",
            "  \nAdherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support  \n5 - 31 5.5.1 Enhanced Adherence Assessments  \nAs soon as treatment failure is suspected the patient/caregiver should be discussed by the facility \nmulti -disciplinary team to develop a plan for assessing barriers to adherence (includin g \nscheduling a home visit), and assessing other potential causes of treatment failure (e.g., \ninadequate dosing/dose adjustments, drug -drug interactions, drug -food interactions, impaired \nabsorption e.g., chronic severe diarrhoea).  \nAll patients with suspecte d or confirmed treatment failure should have a thorough assessment of \npotential barriers to adherence (Table 5.15).  \nIf the patient has a caregiver, treatment buddy, and/or spouse/partner who is enrolled in HIV \ncare, that person\u2019s file should also be review ed to confirm their most recent viral load results and \nadherence.  \n5.5.2 Enhanced Adherence Counselling  \nAdherence assessment and enhanced adherence counselling should begin as soon as a detectable \nviral load ( \u2265 200 copies/ml) is received, preferably within 2 weeks.  \nThe goal of Enhanced Adherence Counselling is to assess possible barriers to adherence in a non -\njudgmental way and to help the patient construct an adherence plan with concrete objectives. It \nis important not to focus solely on k nowledge of HIV and ART but also to review psychological, \nemotional, and socio -economic factors that may contribute to poor adherence. In addition, \nexploring the patient\u2019s motivation for taking medication often highlights reasons for poor \nadherence.  \nAt lea st three sessions of Enhanced Adherence Counselling, spaced 2 -4 weeks apart, are \nrecommended as the minimum number of sessions, but additional sessions can be added as \nneeded (Table 5.1 8). If the adherence is evaluated as adequate, a repeat viral load is d one after \nthree months of excellent adherence, and another Enhanced Adherence Counselling session is \nconducted to discuss the viral load results. A detailed content guide for Enhanced Adherence \nCounselling is provided in Annex 9.  \nIt is preferable to have t he patient go through all adherence counselling sessions with the same \ncounsellor in order to provide continuity, and that the session is documented to ensure follow -up \nof all issues identified.  \nIf adequate adherence cannot be achieved then consult with a senior clinician, discuss as an MDT, \nor consult the Regional or National TWG.  \n  ",
            "  \nKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022  \n5 - 22 Table 5:10 Cont.  \n \n \nHome visit  Observe where and how a patient stores and takes \ntheir medications and assess if they have extra \nmedications because of missed doses. Home visits \nmay also provide a better understanding of a \npatient\u2019s living situation and specific barriers to \nadherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more \nrevealing, but should only be conducted if the  patient \nconsente d to home visits previously (preferably at \nthe time of enrolment or initiation)  For patients with suspected or \nconfirmed treatment failure, \npatients who default from care, \nor any time the MDT feels a \nhome visit will contribute to \npatient management  \n \nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non -\njudgmental relationship with patients.  This is best done when one provider follows an \nindividual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the \nspecifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in \nan open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they \nbelieve the clinician wants to hear: perfe ct adherence.  \nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in \nassessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients \nwho do not have significant barriers to adherence . However, patients with significant adherence \nchallenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional \ntraining and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving \nexperienced colleagu es at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is \nidentified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as \npossible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be require d \nfor complex situations.  \n  ",
