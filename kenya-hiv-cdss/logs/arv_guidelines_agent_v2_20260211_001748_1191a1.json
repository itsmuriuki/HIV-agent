The objectives of this assessment are to evaluate and \nreinforce the patient\u2019s adherence to ART, to elicit any barriers to the same, and to develop a plan \nwith the patient/caregiver to address any of the barriers identified. These may include incorrect \nknowledge of HIV infection and ART, unsupportive psychosocial factors, difficult home or school \nenvironment, substance use and poor motivation for taking medication. Patients/caregivers ne ed \nto be counselled on the importance of being honest about their adherence in order for the \nhealthcare team to serve them better.  \nAdherence monitoring requires a combination of interventions. At every clinical visit, the MMAS -\n4 should be administered as w ell as pill counts. MMAS -8 should be administered any time a \nhealthcare worker suspects adherence problem (e.g., patients with suspected or confirmed \ntreatment failure; patient who misses an appointment).  \n  ",
