HBV/HIV and HCV/HIV Co -infection \nPrevention and Management  \n9.1 Hepatitis B/HIV Co -infection  \nHIV and Hepatitis -B Virus (HBV) share infection transmission routes.  Acute HBV infection in HIV \npositive people is associated with increased risk of chronicity, reduced chances of spontaneous \nclearance, higher rates of replication and reactivation and therefore increased incidence of \nchronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hep atocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, HIV/HBV co -\ninfection has been associated with rapid HIV disease progression and poorer HIV treatment \noutcomes.  Other complications of HIV/HBV co -infection include increased incidence of drug -\nrelated hepatotoxicit y, drug -drug interactions and ART -related immune reconstitution hepatitis.  \n9.1.1 Screening  \nAll adolescents and adults living with HIV (plus children who did not complete routine childhood \nimmunizations) should be screened for HBV infection, using HBsAg, as part of initial evaluation. \nTo promote population -wide prevention, hepatitis B prevention should be integrated into \nroutine HIV prevention and care programs. In this setting, other indications for HBsAg screening \ncould include  \n\u25aa Household and sexual contacts of HBsAg positive individuals  \n\u25aa Pregnant women  \n\u25aa Persons who inject drugs (PWID)  \n\u25aa Men who have sex with men  \n\u25aa Sex workers  \n\u25aa Persons with multiple sexual partners  \n\u25aa Prisoners  \n\u25aa Blood donors  \n\u25aa Unvaccinated healthcare providers  \n \nPLHIV on follow -up who presen t with signs of liver disease (jaundice, ascites, abnormal liver on \npalpation, other signs of cirrhosis) or unexplained and persistent ALT elevation should also be \nscreened for HBV as part of their work -up. \n9.1.2 Prevention  \nA. Vaccination : HBV vaccination reduces the risk of new (incident) HBV infection in PLHIV and \nalso reduces the risk of new infections becoming chronic. Therefore;  \n\u25cf HIV positive infants, children, adolescents and adults without evidence of hepatitis B \ninfection (HBsAg negative)  should be vaccinated against hepatitis B (Table 9.1)  \n\u25cf HIV exposed infants (HEI) should also receive hepatitis B vaccination as part of childhood \nimmunization (Table 4.21)  \n\u25cf As a strategy to reduce the population level burden of HBV infection, HIV prevention and \ntreatment settings should integrate HBV prevention through vaccination. Thus, HBV \nvaccination is recommended for the following groups who test HBsAg negative.  ",

Measure creatinine (and ca lculate estimated creatinine clearance) at \ninitiation of PrEP and annually thereafter (or whenever indicated (symptom \ndirected)).  \nIf creatinine clearance (eGFR) < 50 ml/min do not start PrEP, recheck after 2 \nweeks. Refer for evaluation of underlying renal  disease.  \nIf the renal function returns to normal, reassess for PrEP and initiate/ continue \nPrEP.  \nPrEP should not be prescribed for individuals using nephrotoxic drugs like \nacyclovir, aminoglycosides, retinoids etc. instead, offer alternative HIV \nprevent ion services.  \n \nPregnancy or \nBreastfeeding  \n Pregnancy and breastfeeding are not contraindications to provision of PrEP.  \nPregnant or breastfeeding women whose sexual partners are HIV positive or are \nat high risk of HIV infection may benefit from PrEP as part of combination \nprevention of HIV infection.  \nPrEP is also indicated for HIV -negative women in sero -different partnersh ips \nwho wish to conceive.

HBV/HIV and HCV/HIV Co -infection \nPrevention and Management  \n9.1 Hepatitis B/HIV Co -infection  \nHIV and Hepatitis -B Virus (HBV) share infection transmission routes.  Acute HBV infection in HIV \npositive people is associated with increased risk of chronicity, reduced chances of spontaneous \nclearance, higher rates of replication and reactivation and therefore increased incidence of \nchronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hep atocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, HIV/HBV co -\ninfection has been associated with rapid HIV disease progression and poorer HIV treatment \noutcomes.  Other complications of HIV/HBV co -infection include increased incidence of drug -\nrelated hepatotoxicit y, drug -drug interactions and ART -related immune reconstitution hepatitis.  \n9.1.1 Screening  \nAll adolescents and adults living with HIV (plus children who did not complete routine childhood \nimmunizations) should be screened for HBV infection, using HBsAg, as part of initial evaluation. \nTo promote population -wide prevention, hepatitis B prevention should be integrated into \nroutine HIV prevention and care programs. In this setting, other indications for HBsAg screening \ncould include  \n\u25aa Household and sexual contacts of HBsAg positive individuals  \n\u25aa Pregnant women  \n\u25aa Persons who inject drugs (PWID)  \n\u25aa Men who have sex with men  \n\u25aa Sex workers  \n\u25aa Persons with multiple sexual partners  \n\u25aa Prisoners  \n\u25aa Blood donors  \n\u25aa Unvaccinated healthcare providers  \n \nPLHIV on follow -up who presen t with signs of liver disease (jaundice, ascites, abnormal liver on \npalpation, other signs of cirrhosis) or unexplained and persistent ALT elevation should also be \nscreened for HBV as part of their work -up. \n9.1.2 Prevention  \nA. Vaccination : HBV vaccination reduces the risk of new (incident) HBV infection in PLHIV and \nalso reduces the risk of new infections becoming chronic. Therefore;  \n\u25cf HIV positive infants, children, adolescents and adults without evidence of hepatitis B \ninfection (HBsAg negative)  should be vaccinated against hepatitis B (Table 9.1)  \n\u25cf HIV exposed infants (HEI) should also receive hepatitis B vaccination as part of childhood \nimmunization (Table 4.21)  \n\u25cf As a strategy to reduce the population level burden of HBV infection, HIV prevention and \ntreatment settings should integrate HBV prevention through vaccination. Thus, HBV \nvaccination is recommended for the following groups who test HBsAg negative.  ",
