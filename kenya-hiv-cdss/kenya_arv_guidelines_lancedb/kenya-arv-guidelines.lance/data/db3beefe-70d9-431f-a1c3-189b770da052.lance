Enhanced Adherence Counselling for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Treatment Failure  
Note: for children/adolescents, the script below should be modified towards the caregiver  
Session 1  
• Assess patient’s understanding of ‘viral load’, ‘high viral load’ and ‘suppressed viral load’. Ask 
the patient to explain what each of these terms mean. Provide education if patient requires 
more explanation  
• Provide VL result and explanation of result:  
“You have a detectable viral load. There are several possible reasons for this such as problems with 
adherence, dosing of your medications, interactions wit h other drugs or foods, or possible drugadherence, dosing of your medications, interactions wit h other drugs or foods, or possible drug 
resistance. It is very important for us to work with you determine which may apply to you.”  
• How does the patient feel concerning the result?  
• Explain the process of enhanced adherence:  
“Patients with a high viral load come for at least 3 adherence counselling sessions to discuss what 
might cause a high viral and to look for solutions on how adherence can be improved. Another 
viral load test will be done after 3 months of good adherence to see if the ART can b e continued or 
if we need to change treatment.”  
• Check whether the patient had previous problems with adherence and/or missed 
appointments  
• Ask:  
“Why do you think your viral load is high?”appointments  
• Ask:  
“Why do you think your viral load is high?”  
• Sometimes the patient already knows why his/her VL is detectable. Sta rt by giving them a 
chance to provide their own explanation. Often, they will admit that they are struggling with 
their adherence  
• If they really don’t know why their VL is high you can say:  
“We notice that when people sometimes forget to take their ART everyday it gives the virus a chance 
to multiply. Do you think that you sometimes forget your pills?”  
Assess for Possible Barriers to Adherence  
Cognitive Barriers (HIV and ART knowledge)  
• Assess patient’s knowledge about HIV and ART; correct any misconceptions  
“What is HIV?”  
“What is the immune system and CD4 cells?”  
“What is ART and how does it work?”“What is HIV?”  
“What is the immune system and CD4 cells?”  
“What is ART and how does it work?”  
“Why is it important to be adherent? And how?”  
“Why do you have to come for follow -up appointments? What should you bring?”Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

1 - 4  1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support  
• The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be 
tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow -up 
• All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with < 50 
copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untrans mittable (U=U).  
• Whenever possible, follow -up should be provided by the same care provider or team of 
care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly 
important during the first 3 months in care  
• For all children/adol escents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit.• For all children/adol escents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. 
Ongoing care should include a plan for age -appropriate disclosure  
• All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence 
monitoring, counselling and support s hould continue despite viral suppression  
• Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or 
PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and 
for taking action within 24 hours of a mi ssed appointment  
• In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure 
have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case -
management approach)management approach)  
1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults  
• The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL 
to undetectable levels (Viral Load <50 copies/LD L) 
• All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 
count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co -infection status, 
risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start 
ART  
• ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the  same day as 
confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks)  
• Preferred first -line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults  
▪ Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP▪ Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP  
▪ > 4 weeks to < 15 years old  
▪ < 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG  
▪ ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG  
▪ ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG  
• Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first -
line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred 
regimen  
• Treatment failure is suspected when a pa tient has a VL ≥ 100 0 copies/ml after at least 3 
months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml 
after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then 
repeating VL after at least 3 mo nths of excellent adherence to allow for viral re -
suppressionAnnexes

11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)  
 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition 
of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.  
PrEP is recommended for use as follows:  
• Daily Oral PrEP for all indivi duals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk 
of HIV infection.  
• Event -Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not 
taking exogenous estradiol -based gender affirming hormones  
11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility   
11.1.1 Indications for PrEP  
PrEP is indicated for;  
● HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisitionPrEP is indicated for;  
● HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition  
● Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s 
who is/are:  
o HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non -suppression, 
or on ART with suspected poor adherence  
o In sero -discordant relat ionships trying to conceive  
o Of unknown HIV status and at high -risk of HIV infection  
o Engaging in transactional sex or sex work  
o With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections  
o With recurrent use of Post -Exposure Prophylaxis  
o With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs  
o Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourseo Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse 
with persons of unknown HIV status  
o Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are  shared  
11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment  
Clients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with 
information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in 
addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients ar e assessed for HIV risk before testing.  
The risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual 
to HIV (Table 11.2).  
 A simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating aA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a 
conversat ion about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service 
delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer “yes” to any of the screening questions 
should be engaged in a discussion about the risks and benefits of PrEP. The cl ient then is evaluated 
for eligibility to receive PrEP.Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support  
5 - 31 5.5.1 Enhanced Adherence Assessments  
As soon as treatment failure is suspected the patient/caregiver should be discussed by the facility 
multi -disciplinary team to develop a plan for assessing barriers to adherence (includin g 
scheduling a home visit), and assessing other potential causes of treatment failure (e.g., 
inadequate dosing/dose adjustments, drug -drug interactions, drug -food interactions, impaired 
absorption e.g., chronic severe diarrhoea).  
All patients with suspecte d or confirmed treatment failure should have a thorough assessment of 
potential barriers to adherence (Table 5.15).  
If the patient has a caregiver, treatment buddy, and/or spouse/partner who is enrolled in HIVIf the patient has a caregiver, treatment buddy, and/or spouse/partner who is enrolled in HIV 
care, that person’s file should also be review ed to confirm their most recent viral load results and 
adherence.  
5.5.2 Enhanced Adherence Counselling  
Adherence assessment and enhanced adherence counselling should begin as soon as a detectable 
viral load ( ≥ 200 copies/ml) is received, preferably within 2 weeks.  
The goal of Enhanced Adherence Counselling is to assess possible barriers to adherence in a non -
judgmental way and to help the patient construct an adherence plan with concrete objectives. It 
is important not to focus solely on k nowledge of HIV and ART but also to review psychological, 
emotional, and socio -economic factors that may contribute to poor adherence. In addition,emotional, and socio -economic factors that may contribute to poor adherence. In addition, 
exploring the patient’s motivation for taking medication often highlights reasons for poor 
adherence.  
At lea st three sessions of Enhanced Adherence Counselling, spaced 2 -4 weeks apart, are 
recommended as the minimum number of sessions, but additional sessions can be added as 
needed (Table 5.1 8). If the adherence is evaluated as adequate, a repeat viral load is d one after 
three months of excellent adherence, and another Enhanced Adherence Counselling session is 
conducted to discuss the viral load results. A detailed content guide for Enhanced Adherence 
Counselling is provided in Annex 9.  
It is preferable to have t he patient go through all adherence counselling sessions with the sameIt is preferable to have t he patient go through all adherence counselling sessions with the same 
counsellor in order to provide continuity, and that the session is documented to ensure follow -up 
of all issues identified.  
If adequate adherence cannot be achieved then consult with a senior clinician, discuss as an MDT, 
or consult the Regional or National TWG.HIV Testing Services and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention  
2 - 17  Table 2.4 Cont.  
Systems to 
Facilitate 
Linkage  ● The HTS provider is responsible for linkage into care.  
● Same day enrolment into care is expected. monitor linkage to treatment initiation 
within 14 days of diagnosis, however allow follow up of clients to 90 days of a 
HIV-positive diagnosis  
● For HIV negative clients link to HIV prevention services based on assessed risk  
● Linkage should be done to on -site treatment and prev ention services through 
patient escorts. Where this is not possible (due to patient preference or the 
services are not available), the testing facility should book the appointment with 
the receiving facility and follow -up to ensure the patient registers at  the receivingthe receiving facility and follow -up to ensure the patient registers at  the receiving 
facility. Provide the patient with referral information, referral form and contact 
details of the facility.  
● Deploy retention and loss -to-follow up tracking system to ensure linkage is 
successful. These include enlisting the help of peer or b uddy systems, SMS 
reminders, phone calls and community outreach workers to escort HIV positive 
clients to enrolment.  
● Early preparation and assessment for ART, with early initiation of ART 
strengthens engagement in care.  
Care 
Coordination 
and 
Integration  ● Coordinate and treat mother -baby pairs, partners, and families together. 
Integrate common services offered to PLHIV (TB diagnosis and treatment,Integrate common services offered to PLHIV (TB diagnosis and treatment, 
SRH/FP, cervical cancer screening, nutrition etc.)  
● Where referrals are necessary, such referrals should be coor dinated 
(communication and documentation between referring and receiving service 
delivery points)  
Linkage Register  ● Maintain a linkage register at all testing points in the facility and community.  
● Track and report on progress with linkage monthly  
● Discuss linkage at MDT meetings.  
 
2.5 Retesting recommendations for HIV negative persons  
Retesting in this context refers to testing that occurs later after the initial test is negative.  
The purpose of retesting is to:  
● Monitor the effectiveness of HIV prevention interventionsThe purpose of retesting is to:  
● Monitor the effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions  
● identify and treat new HIV infections as early as possible when prevention efforts fail.  
The following are the recommendations for HIV retesting in different populations and settings in

HIV expo sure  of an infant or child can occur in utero, at labour and delivery and through breast 
milk. Confirmation of HIV infection should immediately follow.  
All HIV exposed infants (HEI) should be tested with DNA PCR within 6 weeks of age or first contact 
there after; if negative then another DNA PCR at 6 months, and if negative then repeat DNA PCR at 
12 months.  
If the HEI develops symptoms suggestive of HIV as per WHO staging criteria, an additional DNA 
PCR test should be conducted immediately.PCR test should be conducted immediately.  
An antibody test  should be performed for all HEI at 18 months of age and every 6 months thereafter 
during breastfeeding, and at 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding (Figure 2.1).Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Section 9: Other medications  
• What other medications will you take, in addition to ART:  
- CPT: all PLHIV should take cotrimoxazole preventive therapy once per day, in order to reduce 
the chance of getting other infections such as pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhoea  
- TPT: all PLHIV should receive 6 months of isoniazid preventive therapy (or another 
approved TPT regimen), unless they have active TB disease, in order to prevent 
development of TB  
• Other medications may be recommended for specific conditions  
Section 10: Nutrition  
• Why is nutrition important:  
- When the viral load is high, your body uses a lot of energy trying to fight the virus- When the viral load is high, your body uses a lot of energy trying to fight the virus  
- If your nutrition is poor, you have more chance of getting other infections as well  
- You need to eat well so your body has everything it needs to fight HIV, and look healthy  
• What can you do to improve your nutrition?  
- Eat a balanced diet from a variety of foods.  
- Try not to eat a lot of sugar, red meat, or fatty/fried foods  
- Try to eat plenty of whole grains, vegetables, fruit, beans, and fish  
- Drink plenty of clean safe water  
- Physical activity and exercise is encouraged.  
Section 11: Follow -up 
• How often will you need to come to the clinic  
- Before starting ART: you should come to the clinic at least every week in order to get you preparedfor ART so you can start as soon as possible  
- Soon after starting ART: after you start ART you should come to the clinic in 2 weeks in order to 
see if you have had any trouble taking your pills or have developed any side effects; then you can 
be seen after another two weeks for the same; then every month until your first viral load test  
- Once you have been on ART for a while: if your first viral load (after 3 months) is undetectable 
then you can be seen every 1 -6 months depending on other factors  that will be discussed with the 
clinician  
- Unscheduled visits: if you ever have any concerns, feel unwell, or need to speak with any of the 
clinic team then you can call or come to the clinic, even if you do not have an appointment 
scheduled for that dayscheduled for that day  
• What will we be checking for during your clinic visits  
- At each visit you will be asked if you have had any illnesses since the last visit, if you have had any 
trouble taking your ART, and if you are experiencing any side effects. You may need a physic al 
exam or blood tests at some visits  
Section 12: ART readiness assessment  
• Are you ready to start ART today?  
- Complete the ART Readiness Assessment (Table 5.4) for each patient to see if they should 
start ART today, and if not, to identify what issues need to be addressed before starting

 10 - 4 10.5 Risk reduction counselling  
To reduce the risk of further HIV transmission, it is necessary to prevent transmission to sexual 
partners and the children of breastfeeding mothers. R isk reduction counselling should form part 
of each consultation with the individual. Measures to reduce transmission to another person may 
include:  
● The use of condoms and safe injecting practices to prevent secondary transmission  
● Avoiding blood donation until confirmed HIV negative at 12 weeks post exposure  
Table 10.3 Considerations for special circumstances  
Circumstance   Recommendation  
Breastfeeding women  • Breastfeeding is not a contraindication for PEP  
• The risks and benefits of continuing breastfeeding while HIV• The risks and benefits of continuing breastfeeding while HIV 
transmission risk is unknown and should be discussed with the 
mother  
Children  • HIV testing approaches for children should be in line with national 
guidelines and age appropriate  
• Informed consent from the caregiver is needed  
Adolescents  • Requiring parental consent for adolescents can be a barrier to HIV 
testing, particularly in cases of sexual assault  
• HIV testing should be performed in accordance with national 
guidelines and consenting requirements  
 
10.6 Preventing HIV exposure  
To avoid or minimize the risk of exposure to HIV the following infection prevention control (IPC) 
measures are recommended:  
• Precautions should be taken when handling contaminated body fluids including the use• Precautions should be taken when handling contaminated body fluids including the use 
of appropriate barriers such as gloves, gowns, and goggles.  
• Care with sharps including minimizing blind surgical procedures and proper handling 
and disposal o f sharps.  
• Safe disposal of contaminated waste  
• Safe handling of soiled linen.  
• Adequate disinfection procedures  
• Universal Hepatitis B vaccination of non -immune at -risk groups including HCWs, police, 
prison staff and rescue workers.  
In cases that do not requi re PEP, the exposed person should be counselled about limiting future 
exposure risk.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

5.5 Adherence Monitoring, Counselling and Support for Patients with 
Unsuppressed Viral Load ≥ 200 copies/ml  
Treatment failure should be suspected whenever a patient has been on ART for at least 3 months 
and has: a viral load ≥ 200 copies/ml; a decline in CD4 count or; a ny new or worsening clinical 
condition. Treatment failure is confirmed as per the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6). 
Poor adherence is often the most important factor in developing treatment failure, though there 
can be other causes. Adherence m ust be thoroughly assessed and all issues must be addressedcan be other causes. Adherence m ust be thoroughly assessed and all issues must be addressed 
before switching patients to the next line of ART. Do not change regimens until the reason/s 
for treatment failure have been identified and addressed, and a repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 
copies/ml after 3 months of excellent adherence . For patients with high -risk  persistent low -
level viremia (VL 200 - 999 copies/ml after additional assessment and intervention), consult the 
Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; 
https://nh csc.nascop.org/clinicalform ).Standard Package of Care for PLHIV  
4 - 1   
4. Standard Package of Care for PLHIV  
 
All PLHIV should receive a package of services that are known to promote health, improve the 
quality of life, prevent further HIV transmission, and prevent HIV disease progression and 
mortality.  
The standard package of care for PLHIV in cludes: antiretroviral therapy; Positive Health, Dignity 
and Prevention (PHDP) services; screening and providing support in cases of gender -based 
violence (GBV) or intimate -partner violence (IPV); HIV education/counselling; screening and 
prevention of spec ific opportunistic infections; reproductive health services; screening for and 
management of non -communicable diseases; mental health screening and management;management of non -communicable diseases; mental health screening and management; 
nutritional services; and prevention of other infections (Table 4.1).  
The standard package of ca re should always be applied using a patient - and family -
centered approach  in PLHIV management.  Patient -centered care includes: considering the 
individual patient’s health needs; eliciting and addressing the patient’s concerns and expectations; 
involving th e patient’s (and their family and friends as appropriate) in decision -making, and; 
respecting the patient’s values and preferences. Family -centered care identifies, engages and 
provides care to all HIV -positive family members, prevents new infections among  family members 
at risk, and promotes family support and awareness.Initial Evaluation and Follow up  
3 - 15  Facility -based ART Distribution Group  
Facility -based ART Distribution Groups are a model for ART distribution, whereby a group of 
PLHIVs meet at a designated location within their health facility for drug refills and dispense 
drugs to their peers within the group while ensuring peer support and treatment literacy.  ART 
refills are done through the group every 3 months and  each client is required to attend their 
clinical review appointment e very 6 months.   
This model may provide clients with psychosocial support if they are not already part of a support 
group. This may also be more convenient for clients who are in urban settings and would not wishgroup. This may also be more convenient for clients who are in urban settings and would not wish 
to be enrolled in a community -based group. F acility -based groups can be peer or HCW led.  
Community -based ART Distribution Models  
Clients may receive ART refills through community -based distribution. All clients may also benefit 
from home visits such as for adherence monitoring and support, on a case -by-case basis.  
Clients can receive their ART refill through community -based models such as:  
● Community -based ART distribution groups  
● Community ART distribution points  
● Community pharmacy distribution  
Before implementing a community -based ART distribution program, a health facility should workBefore implementing a community -based ART distribution program, a health facility should work 
with the CHMT to design a program that meets the criteria listed in Annex 14, and the plan 
approved by the County HIV Technical Working Group before implementation. Refer to DSD

- Distance: choosing an HIV clinic that is far away from your home can make it difficult to come to 
appointments and pick drugs regularly  
- HIV knowledge: when people do not understand what HIV is, and why ART is important, they 
may not take their drugs properly. This also applies to children and adolescents, if they have 
not been told they have HIV and taught what it means  
- Mental health disorders: depression and other mental illnesses can make it difficult to t ake ART 
correctly

- Discuss strategies to manage any expected barriers to adherence  
• What can help you take ART as prescribed  
- Disclosure: It is easier to take your ART properly when the people close to you know your HIV 
status, so you do not have to try and hide your ART or miss doses to avoid being seen. Family 
and friends can also provide additional support once they  are aware you have HIV and 
understand more about it. We can help you disclose your HIV status to important family 
members or friends when you are readymembers or friends when you are ready  
- Treatment supporter: Having a “treatment buddy” can help you take your ART correctly; ask a 
friend, par tner, or family member to remind you to take your ART. If possible, invite that 
person with you to some of your clinic appointments and counselling sessions so they can learn 
about ART, the importance of good adherence, side effects, etc.  
- SMS reminder syst em (if SMS reminder system in place at the facility): Receiving a regular SMS, 
e.g., every week, can help you take your ART correctly. We enroll all our patients into this 
service for SMS reminders at our clinic, unless you do not want to receive them. The  messages 
simply ask how you are doing, and do not mention HIV, ART, the clinic, or anything else thatsimply ask how you are doing, and do not mention HIV, ART, the clinic, or anything else that

have economic activities to help increase your income. We have support groups based at the 
health facility, and there are also support groups in the community  
- Other reminders:

Considerations  Recommendation  
Management at initial 
contact  ● Counsel on risks and benefits of PEP and obtain verbal consent for HIV 
testing.  
● Voluntary testing for both exposed and source individuals  
● Offer PEP as soon as high -risk exposure is established and the exposed 
individual tests HIV-negative at baseline (if HIV testing not feasible, 
offer 1 -2 days of PEP to cover until HIV test performed)  
● Provide first aid in case of broken skin or other type of wound  
Time of initiation  As soon as possible after exposure, but no later than after 72 hours  
Duration of PEP  28 days (dispense all 28 days of treatment at the first visit if tested HIV negative)Dose of PEP  Same as indicated for treatment; use weight -based dosing for children  
Laboratory 
investigation at 
baseline  ● Conduct creatine testing (if TDF -containing regimen) and Hb (if AZT -
containing regimen), however PEP should be offered even when lab tests 
are not available. Do not delay administration of PEP while waiting for lab 
results.  
● HBsAg testing is recommended. Do not del ay administration of PEP while 
waiting for lab results. If negative provide HBV vaccination  
● Pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential in case of sexual 
assault.  
Follow -up ● Follow up client at 7 days, 14 days, 28 days, and 12 weeks after starting 
PEP  
● Assess for and manage side effects due to PEP  
● Follow -up HIV testing should be done at the completion of PEP and if● Follow -up HIV testing should be done at the completion of PEP and if 
negative, test again at 12 weeks  
● Link to HIV treatment if positive  
Counselling  Counselling at baseline should include:  
● Adherence counselling  
● Information on side effects  
● Risk reduction counselling  
● Trauma and mental health counselling  
● Specific support for sexual assault

  7 - 5 7.2. Syphilis elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeed ing Women and Infant 
Treatment  
The country has adopted triple elimination of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B among pregnant and 
breastfeeding women. It is recommended that all pregnant women attending ANC and not aware 
of their HIV status require a dual HIV syphilis test during their first trimester and a second HIV 
Syphilis test in the 3rd trimester if the initial test was negative.   
All women who test positive for syphilis at any point during pregnancy and breastfeeding should 
be treated with the appropria te regimen. (Table 7.3). All babies born of mothers who test positivefor syphilis are suspected to be exposed to syphilis and should also be treated with the correct 
regimen (Table 7.3). Ensure to perform contact tracing for all the sexual contacts and en sure they 
are treated for syphilis.  
Symptoms of congenital syphilis may not become apparent for several weeks or months after 
birth.  
7.3. Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant 
Prophylaxis  
Requires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for 
their own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral 
hepatitis B.  
Regular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as  part of the ANCRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as  part of the ANC 
profile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B & C which pose a big risk to both the mother and 
fetus.  
For pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate 
treatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also 
acts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child. All pregnant and breastfeeding 
women without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against 
hepatitis B. (Chapter 9).  
HIV positive infants without evidence of infection should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B.  
Infants born of mothers who test positive for HBsAG should be treated using Hepatitis BInfants born of mothers who test positive for HBsAG should be treated using Hepatitis B 
Immunoglobulin (Table 7.3).

Suppressed Viral Load < 200 copies/ml  
Once a patient has confirmed viral suppression (with VL < 50 copies/ml or below the Lower 
Detection Limit (LDL)) this is confirmation of adequate adherence to ART. The patient can be 
reassured that they will do well if they continue to adhere. Ho wever, all patients are at risk of new 
or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should 
continue despite viral suppression, but at a lower intensity and frequency unless concerns are 
identified (Table 5.16). These  patients should also be educated on and assessed for qualificationidentified (Table 5.16). These  patients should also be educated on and assessed for qualification 
as “stable patient” services such as less frequent facility visits, fast -track or community -based ART 
distribution, etc. (Table 3.5).

3 - 14  Adolescents:  Adolescents requi re psychosocial support, ongoing adherence assessments and 
counselling which should be aligned with clinic visits, community follow -up as well as school 
calendar.  Considerations should be factored in during the clinical encounters with more focus to 
those  with adherence and viral suppression challenges. Adolescents and Youth Friendly services 
that incorporate life skills and extracurricular activities should be integrated where feasible.  
Pregnant/breastfeeding women:  Pregnant and breastfeeding women who h ave been established 
on ART should have their HIV clinic appointments synchronized with Antenatal Care visits and withon ART should have their HIV clinic appointments synchronized with Antenatal Care visits and with 
follow -up of the HIV -exposed infant. Those initiated on ART during pregnancy may need close 
follow up to support them in adherence, reten tion and achieving viral suppression. Breast feeding 
women and their babies will have their clinical visit aligned with the immunization clinics schedule. 
Psychosocial support groups are encouraged for both pregnant and breastfeeding mothers 
including peer  to peer support.  
3.8 ART Prescription, Dispensing, and Distribution for clients established on 
ART  
Patients who are established on ART should be offered ART  refills of up to 3 months. The refill ofother associated commodities such as cotrimoxazole, TPT a nd condoms should be aligned to the 
ART refill schedule. Clients established on ART should receive their ART, CPT, family planning, and 
any other chronic medicines through a distribution system that minimizes the burden on them 
(travel costs, waiting times , inconvenience) and burden on the health facility (personnel time, 
space constraints, etc.). This must be on a voluntary basis (i.e., the client can choose to remain in 
standard care if they prefer).  
The health facility is responsible for ART prescription , dispensing, and distribution for all patients 
enrolled into care. ART distribution for patients established on ART can take place at the healthenrolled into care. ART distribution for patients established on ART can take place at the health 
facility or through a community distribution system, depending on patient preference and health 
facility syste ms and resources. The point of ART dispensing should be based on client ability 
to access treatment with ease.  Models for ART refills include:  
● Facility -based  
o Fast track facility -based refills  
o Facility -based ART distribution groups  
● Community -based  
o Community -based ART distribution groups  
o Community ART distribution points  
o Community pharmacy distribution  
Facility -based Fast Track System for ART Refills  
The facility -based fast track system for ART  refills is a simple model implemented at the healthThe facility -based fast track system for ART  refills is a simple model implemented at the health 
facility. The client is still required to come to the clinic every 3 months for ART refill, however the 
refill appointments require minimal or no waiting time at the clinic.   Refer to DSD operational 
manual for detailed information on community models.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Section 8: Adherence  
• What is adherence  
- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team  
- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled  
- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed  
- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule  
- Following nutritional recommendations  
• How should ART be taken  
- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will 
not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with 
someone else  
- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight  
- You must take ART the correct time of day:- You must take ART the correct time of day:  
• If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be 
convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.  
• If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to 
take your dr ugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It 
does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most 
important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 
8.00 pm every day)  
- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not 
within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do notwithin a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not 
take a double -dose of ART to make up for a missed dose  
- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for 
some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach. These dietary 
restrictions will be explained to you once your ART regimen is  selected  
- It is essential to take ART as prescribed and not miss any doses  
- Some medications (prescription, non -prescription, and herbal) interact with ART and make 
them ineffective. Be sure to tell your clinician and pharmacist the names of all the medicat ions 
(including traditional/herbal) that you are taking, and any time you are given new medications. 
Avoid use of alcoholAvoid use of alcohol  
• What usually interferes with good adherence (can apply to the patient or to the caregiver)  
- Stigma: it is hard to take ART correctly if you need to hide it because you are worried about 
people finding out you have HIV  
- Disclosure: it is hard to take ART correctly if the people closest to you, particularly family 
members and close friends, do not know you have HIV  
- Change in rout ine: if your daily routine suddenly changes it may be difficult to remember to 
take your ART at the usual time  
- Travel: frequent travel, or unexpected travel (such as for a funeral) may interfere with taking 
ART, particularly if you do not have enough drugs  with you for the entire tripART, particularly if you do not have enough drugs  with you for the entire trip  
- Alcohol and drug use: it is hard to remember to take ART when under the influence of alcohol 
or other drugs  
- Caregiver changes: every time a child has a new caregiver, that person needs to learn about 
how and why ART is taken  
- Side effects: when people get side effects from ART they sometimes stop or reduce the amount 
of ART they are taking, hoping it will reduce the side effects  
- Pill burden/palatability: sometime the number of pills (or taste of syrups for children) makes it 
difficult to take ART correctlyKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

4 - 36  4.7 Nutritional Services  
Good nutrition is a critical component of management of HIV because it contributes to: reducing 
risk and frequency of other infections; delaying progression from HIV infection to AIDS; a healthy 
appearance and weight; gaining strength, maintaining and building muscle, and having energy to 
remain active, and reducing side effects of ART.

 10 - 2 10.3 Eligibility For PEP  
PEP should always be offered as soon as possible, preferably within 72 hours, after an exposure.  
Persons who present after 72 hours should be provided with other appropriate services including 
counselling and support.  
Eligibilit y assessment for PEP is based on the type of exposure, HIV status of source where 
possible and timing of seeking care.  
The following include the eligibility criteria for PEP.  
● Exposed individual is HIV negative at baseline.  
● Exposure must have occurred within the past 72 hours.  
● Exposure to bodily fluids pose a significant risk (exposure and/or material):  
▪ Type of exposure:  mucous membrane (i.e.  sexual exposure; splashes to eye, nose, or▪ Type of exposure:  mucous membrane (i.e.  sexual exposure; splashes to eye, nose, or 
oral cavity), non -intact skin, percutaneous injury or paren teral exposures  
▪ Material : blood, blood -stained body fluids, breast milk; semen; vaginal secretions; 
synovial, pleural, pericardial, amniotic fluids; CSF, and HIV cultures in laboratories  
Exposures that do not require HIV PEP include:  
● When the exposed individual is already HIV positive.  
● Exposures to bodily fluids that do not pose a significant risk, i.e., tears, non -blood -stained 
saliva, urine, and sweat.  
10.4 Management and Follow Up  
Patients should be counselled and encouraged to complete the full course of PEP once a decision 
has been made to initiate PEP.has been made to initiate PEP.  
For occupational exposure, immediate care of the exposure site includes washing the site with 
soap and water and allow the wound  to bleed freely for several minutes

referrals need to be re -organized?Summary of Key Recommendations  
1 - 1   
1. Summary of Key Recommendations  
 
1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention  
• HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where 
Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating 
an enabling environment can be assured  
• To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:  
▪ Facility -based  
▪ Community -based  
• Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV 
self-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as 
eligible for testingeligible for testing  
• Serial testing, using ap proved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV 
infection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV -positive 
diagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays  
 
1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow -up for PLHIV  
● Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:  
▪ Baseline investigation for all PLHIV  
▪ Any patient with suspected treatment failure  
▪ Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for > 3 months  
▪ Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to 
determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued  
● Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued  
● Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:  
▪ Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of 
less than 200 cells/mm3 or 
▪ WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease  
▪ All children younger than five years  
● All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of 
care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophyl axis, and 
management  of opportunistic infections.  
● Frequency of routine VL monitoring:  
▪ For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)  
▪ Age 0 -24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months  
▪ Age ≥ 25 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, then at month 12, and then annuallyAnnexes

Section 6: Treatment failure  
• What happens if you stop taking ART:  
- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly  
- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART  
• What happens if you do not take ART regularly:  
- The virus begins to increase to high levels again  
• What happens if t he viral load increases:  
- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count 
putting you at risk of opportunistic infections  
- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, a nd becomes resistance to 
the ART  
- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymorethe ART  
- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore  
- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the 
medications several times  
- When resistance o ccurs, this is called treatment failure  
• What happens in treatment failure:  
- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it  
- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well  
- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects  
- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, 
and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 coun t will go way downand the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 coun t will go way down  
- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment 
failure, and can live a long and healthy life  
Section 7: ART side effects  
• What are the side -effects of ART:  
- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART  
- Side effects vary from person to person  
- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable  
- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve aft er a few weeks or 
months  
- Some common side effects include:  
● Headache  
● Loss of appetite  
● Skin rash  
● Fatigue  
● Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea  
● Muscle pains● Loss of appetite  
● Skin rash  
● Fatigue  
● Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea  
● Muscle pains  
• What do you do if you notice any side effects:  
- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any 
doses, until you discuss with the clinician  
- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then 
discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment  
- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not 
have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able 
to make it yourself immediatelyto make it yourself immediately  
- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, 
inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this 
occurs then contact the clinic immediately

  7 - 3 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV -positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding 
Women and Infant Prophylaxis  
The goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two -fold: to restore and maintain the 
mother’s immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission 
of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother 
must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.  Table 7.2 summarizes 
recommendations for use of ART for HIV positive pregnant women.  
Table 7.2: Summary of Use of A RT for HIV Positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women  
Overall recommendationsOverall recommendations  
When to start  ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, 
regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 cell count and continued 
lifelong. ART should be started, ideally, on same day as HIV diagnosis after 
readiness asse ssment with ongoing enhanced adherence support including 
community -based case management and support.

prophylaxis  ● AZT+NVP for 6 weeks, NVP should be continued until 6 weeks after complete 
cessation of breastfeeding

Monitoring       Viral load  monitoring during pregnancy and breast -feeding (Figure 6.6)Monitoring       Viral load  monitoring during pregnancy and breast -feeding (Figure 6.6)  
● Whenever possible, use same -day point -of-care methods for viral load 
testing of pregnant and breastfeeding women to expedite the return of 
results and clinical decision -making. If this is not available, viral load 
specimens and results for pregnant and breastfeeding women should be 
given priority across the laboratory referral process  (including specimen 
collection, testing and return of results).  
● For pregnant and breastfeeding women newly initiated on ART, obtain VL 3 
months after initiation, and then every 6 months until complete cessation of 
breastfeeding  
● For HIV positive women already on ART at the time of confirming pregnancybreastfeeding  
● For HIV positive women already on ART at the time of confirming pregnancy 
or breastfeeding, obtain a VL irrespective of when prior VL was done, and 
then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding  
● For pregnant or breastfeeding women with a VL ≥ 50 copies/ml: assess for 
and address potential reasons for viremia, including intensifying adherence 
support, repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence, including 
daily witnessed ingestion, where feasible and appropriate  
o If the repeat VL is 200 - 999 copies/ml consul t the Regional or National 
HIV Clinical TWG  
o If the repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml, change to an effective regimen.

4 - 35  Staying connected  
This is extremely important. Increasingly in the present world disconnection is leading to more 
and more phy sical and mental ill health. Staying connected with family and friends as well as 
spiritual support systems enable  one to better manage their lives as they work towards being as 
mentally healthy as possible.  
4.6.8 Wellbeing  
According to the WHO, mental hea lth is a state of well -being in which an individual realizes his or 
her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to 
make a contribution to his or her community.  
Support structures for wellbeing:  
The suppor t structures for wellbeing are available at different levels of implementation which are:• Individual counselling  
• Group therapy  
• Networks of organizations providing support to different categories of populations in 
different age sets such as adolescents, me n, women etc.  
Health workers in facilities should take the initiative to set up/ maintain these structures and 
establish referral systems for clients in need of these services. Referral for PLHIV should include 
services that address issues that potentially could affect the mental health of PLHIV such as social 
and financial issues.ARVs for Post -exposure Prophylaxis  
10 - 1  
10. ARVs for Post -exposure Prophylaxis  
 
 
An ARV regimen, with preferably three -drugs, should be offered as post exposure prophylaxis as 
soon as possible (preferably within 72 hours) after an exposure.  
  
10.1 What is PEP?  
Post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is short -term use of antiretroviral treatment to reduce the 
likelihood of HIV infection after potential exposure.  
People can be accidentally exposed to HIV through healthcare work or due to exposures outside 
healthcare setting, for example, through unprotected sex or sexual assault among adults and 
children. Healthcare workers are at increased risk of exposure to HIV through contact withchildren. Healthcare workers are at increased risk of exposure to HIV through contact with 
contaminated blood and other body fluids  containing HIV through needle stick injuries and 
injuries by other sharp objects or through non -intact skin and mucous membranes.  
10.2 Recommended ARVs for PEP  
Three -drug regimens are preferred for PEP. However, if the person is unable to tolerate the thi rd 
drug, (usually the PI/r), two drugs  can be used.

● Encourage adolescents to identify and invite a supportive adult or friend to 
support them.  
● For children, HIV status should be disclosed to children by age 12 years and the 
process can start when a child is as young as 7 years old.  The health care provider 
or the pa rent/caregiver/guardian can disclose to the child with appropriate 
guidance and training. The aim of disclosure to children is to start to involve them

 2This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to 
schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV 
clinic for unscheduled appointment whenever  an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at 
another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification , every 
appointment should include:  
− Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)  
− Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication  
−  Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling

monthly appointments until month 6.  
4 All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and 
within 2 weeks. For patients who do not  start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, 
they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are 
delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment 
preparation and ART r eadiness assessment.

In adults, weig ht and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status 
and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.  
6The first 2 -4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managi ng adverse 
drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at 
every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and

3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/ breastfeeding 
Women  
Children, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique 
challenges in retention  and viral suppression and  hence may benefit more from different iated 
service delivery models  adapted to their needs.  
Children:  Children’s care is dependent on family and care giver dynamics. Family centered 
approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, 
should be used.  A ssessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should beshould be used.  A ssessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be 
conducted for pairs and follow -up tailored to their situations. Weight -based dose adjustments 
should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable  weighing 
scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review.  Aligning 
appointments with school calendar should be considered to avert disruption of treatment and 
learning of the child.HIV Testing Services and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention

Section 5: Antiretroviral therapy (ART)  
• What is ART:  
- ART is a combination of 3 or more different medicines  
- ART fights HIV, lowering the amount of virus in the body allowing the body to protect 
itself against opportunistic infections  
- When the virus level is low then the CD4 count can increase  
- Increased CD4 count means the body is able to protect itself against opportunistic infections  
 
• What are the benefits of ART:  
- After a few weeks of taking ART, you will begin to regain appetite and weight (if it has been 
affected)  
- Many people report an increase in their energy levels and general sense of well being- Many people report an increase in their energy levels and general sense of well being  
- People can often return to work or school or care for their families  
- With ART,  people with HIV can live a long and healthy life if they take it properly  
 
• When is ART started:  
- Everybody with HIV should start ART  
- Even if your CD4 count is high, the virus is doing damage inside of you and needs to be 
controlled  
- ART should be started as soon as you are ready, preferably within 2 weeks  
- The longer you wait to start ART, the more time the virus can damage your body, increasing 
your chances of getting sick or even dying  
- Sometimes ART is started a few weeks later if you have certain infections, or if you do not 
think you are ready to take them properlythink you are ready to take them properly  
 
• Does ART cure HIV:  
- ART does not cure HIV  
- ART lowers the amount of virus in your body so your body can protect itself from infections  
- It does not remove the virus completely  
 
• Can you still give HIV to others while taking ART:  
- Transmission of HIV is very unlikely once your viral load is undetectable  
- You should practice safer sex to reduce the risk for other infections as well, including 
disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners and consistent and correct condom use  
 
• How long is ART taken for:  
- ART is a life -long treatment  
- Once you start ART, you need to take it every day for the rest of your life (either once a day, 
or twice a day, depending on which drugs you are on)or twice a day, depending on which drugs you are on)  
- You must take the ART as prescribed and never miss a dose otherwise the treatment might 
fail and the drugs stop working against the virusKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

HIV testing algorithm for children >1 8months, adolescents and adults.  
Figure 2.3 illustrates the serial testing algorithm. An HIV -positive diagnosis will be made using 
three consecutive reactive assays (Figure 2.3). All individuals are first tested on Assay 1 (A1). 
Anyone with a non -reactive test result (A1−) is reported HIV -negative.  Individuals who are 
reactive on Assay 1 (A1+) will then be tested on a separate and distinct Assay 2 (A2). Individuals 
who are reactive on both Assay 1 and Assay 2 (A1+; A2+) will then be tested on a separate an d 
distinct Assay 3 (A3). A positive HIV diagnosis is given when Assay 3 is reactive (A1+; A2+; A3+).  
If Assay 3 is nonreactive (A1+; A2+; A3−), the status should be reported as HIV -inconclusive, andIf Assay 3 is nonreactive (A1+; A2+; A3−), the status should be reported as HIV -inconclusive, and 
the individual should be asked to return in 14 days for retesting.   
Individuals who are reactive on Assay 1 but non -reactive on Assay 2 (A1+; A2−) should be repeated 
on Assay 1. If repeat Assay 1 is non -reactive (A1+; A2−; repeat A1 –), the status should be reported 
as HIV -negative.  If repeat Assay 1 is reactive (A1+; A2 –; repeat A1+), the status should be reported 
as HIV -inconclusive, and the individual asked  to return in 14 days for retesting.   All clients with 
HIV positive results will be referred to a Comprehensive Care Clinic for retesting prior to 
initiation of ART

Psychosis is a mental disorder characterized by a disconnection from reality.  
Psychosis may occur as a result of a psychiatri c illness such as schizophrenia. In other instances, 
it may be caused by a health condition, medication or drug use.  
Signs and Symptoms of psychosis  
• Marked behavioural changes  
• Neglecting usual responsibilities related to work, school, domestic or social activities  
• Agitated, aggressive behaviour, decreased or increased activity  
• Fixed false beliefs not shared by others in the person’s culture  
• Hearing voices or seeing things that are not there  
• Lack of realization that one is having mental health problems  
Treatment may include medication and talk therapy.Treatment may include medication and talk therapy.  
4.6.7 Self -Care  
Overall, in the context of mental health, taking up self -care strategies will help individuals live 
both more responsibly, and more satisfactorily as this helps boost both physical and mental 
health.  
Self-care strategies include the following;  
− Getting regular exercise  
− Eating healthy, regular meals and staying well hydrated  
− Making sleep a priority. Many people struggle with this but just getting regular sleep with 
a constant waking and sleeping time contribute tremendously to good self-care  as well as 
good, well rested physical and mental health  
− Taking up a relaxing activity  
− Setting goals and priorities.− Taking up a relaxing activity

Practicing gratitude  
Reminding oneself that things that one is grateful for. The more specific one is, the easier it is to 
even be grateful for them. Listing them down is a good way of getting such clarity  
Focusing on positivity  
The calls for appreciating the good and positive things that have happened, are going on and are 
planned for in one’s life. The things to look forward to. This strategy also calls for the identification 
and challenging of negative and unhelpful thoughts. Good friends and counsellors, as well as other 
health workers with mental health skills can assist in this.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Section 3: Viral load  
• What is viral load  
- Viral load is the amount of HIV in your body  
- When your viral load is high it means you have a lot of HIV in your body; this causes damage to 
your body  
- Viral load is measured by a blood test  
 
• How often is viral load measured  
- Viral load is measured after being on treatment for 3 months  
- After 3 months of treatment, we expect the amount of virus in your body to be undetectable; if 
your VL is detectable then we have to discuss the reasons  
- Having an “undetectable” VL means the test cannot measure the virus in your blood because 
your ART is working, but it does not mean you are no longer infected with HIVyour ART is working, but it does not mean you are no longer infected with HIV  
- Repeat viral load tests are done dependin g on how you are doing; if you are doing well on 
treatment then the viral load is measured again every 6 months (for children/adolescents and 
pregnant/breastfeeding) or annually  
- For HEI with positive PCR, we also measure viral load at the start of treatmen t 
 
• What do viral load measurements mean  
- After being on treatment for 3 or more months, your viral load should be undetectable  
- If your viral load is undetectable, it means your treatment is working well and you should 
continue taking it the same; the virus is not damaging your body any more  
- If your viral load is detectable, it means your treatment is not working properly, usually becauseyou have been missing some of your pills; the virus is damaging your body and you and the clinic 
team will need to work together to figure out how to fix the problem  
Section 4: CD4 cells  
• What are CD4 cells  
- CD4 cells are the immune cells that protect the body from infections  
- CD4 cells are measured through a blood test, called CD4 count. For adults a normal CD4 count is 
above 500  
 
• How are CD4 cells affected by HIV  
- HIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells  
- After years of constant attack from HIV, the CD4 count falls  
 
• What happens when CD4 cells decrease  
- When the CD4 count falls too low (usually below 200), diseases called “opportunistic infections” 
are able to infect the body because the body cannot defend itselfare able to infect the body because the body cannot defend itself  
- Common opportunistic infections include: tuberculosis, pneumonia, skin problems, white spots 
in the mouth, and chronic diarrhoea  
 
• How often is CD4 count measured  
- CD4 count is measured for all patients at the beginning of treatment, to see if you are likely to get 
any opportunistic infections  
- Once you start treatment for HIV, we do not need to check CD4 count frequently, but we will use 
the VL tes t to monitor your response to anti -retroviral treatmentPrevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV/Syphilis/Hepatitis B

7. Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of 
HIV/Syphilis/Hepatitis B  
Routine antenatal care (ANC) offers an important opportunity to provide high quality combined 
HIV prevention throug h targeted health education and counselling; HIV testing for the woman, 
partners and family members; linkage to HIV prevention and treatment; and to discuss and plan 
for future conception and contraception needs. Prevention of mother -to-child transmission of HIV 
(PMTCT)/Syphilis/Hepatitis B should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully 
integrated, routine antenatal care interventions (Table 7.1).  
Table 7.1: Essential Package of Antenatal Care  
Intervention  Recommendation/DescriptionTable 7.1: Essential Package of Antenatal Care  
Intervention  Recommendation/Description  
 
Group & 
Individual 
Education  Include information on importance of at least 8  ANC visits, details of ANC services 
(including health checks and treatment of any illness, medical tests including HIV, 
syphilis testing and hepatitis B, monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing, etc.), 
nutrition, personal care, recognizing and responding to danger signs during 
pregnancy, birth preparedness including skilled birth attendance, post -natal care 
including immunization, family pla nning and maternal and infant nutrition, HIV 
prevention and treatment (HTS, preventing new infections during pregnancy 
including PrEP where appropriate, ART for those who are HIV positive, monitoring ofincluding PrEP where appropriate, ART for those who are HIV positive, monitoring of 
ART and ARV prophylaxis and follow -up for HEIs) and t riple elimination (preventing 
HIV/ syphilis/hepatitis B transmission from mother to child).  
Counselling  ● Pre-conception – Women in reproductive age who are known to be HIV positive 
should have pregnancy intention assessment visit at every visit. If they desire to 
become pregnant, pregnancy should be planned i.e., attain viral load suppression, 
immune reconsti tution and have Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (IFAS) 
administered prior to conception.  
● Women who are newly diagnosed with HIV and/or newly initiating ART require 
more intensive adherence counseling and HIV education, which may include a case 
manager  and/or mentor mothermanager  and/or mentor mother  
● Birth preparedness: support the pregnant woman and her partner to develop an 
individual birth plan that includes place of delivery with skilled attendants, 
emergency transport, birth companionship and readiness for infant care  
● Pregnan cy danger signs: offer information on returning to ANC as soon as possible 
in case they develop fever, lower abdominal pain, severe headache, swollen feet, 
convulsions and per vaginal bleeding.  
● Maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN): All pregn ant women should 
receive information on proper nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding, safe 
infant feeding and optimal nutrition practices. Promote exclusive breastfeeding forinfant feeding and optimal nutrition practices. Promote exclusive breastfeeding for 
the first 6 months irrespective of HIV status, followed by complementary f eeding 
(Table 7.7). During pregnancy, provide iron, folate and multivitamins; monitor for 
anemia, advise on adequate caloric intake (HIV positive women require an 
additional 10% of recommended daily allowance (RDA))Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

severe enough to negatively impact their lives. The stress may be so severe  as to be observed by 
anyone interacting with the individual and may manifest in their behaviour and the symptoms 
they complain about. It is important for the health care worker to be calm, and assured as they 
address the patient’s concerns around stress. Further, a  screening tool can be used to assess the 
need for referral to more specialized mental health workers to provide much needed support.

5.3.2 Adherence Counselling and Support During the First 3 Months of ART  
All patients recently initiated on ART need careful adherence monitoring and support to 
ensure they achieve virological suppression.  This is particularly important in the context of 
rapid ART initiation. The intensity of counselling and support are dependent on the patients’ level 
of adherence as assessed by the methods described i n section 5.2.1.  
Table 5.14 summarizes adherence counselling and support for patients from the time of ARTTable 5.14 summarizes adherence counselling and support for patients from the time of ART

9 - 5 E. Second line for HIV/ HBV co -infected  
Maintain TDF + 3TC in the ART regimen for patients switc hing from TDF -based -therapy.  So, for 
example, if a patient with HIV/HBV co -infection fails TDF/3TC/EFV in first -line, they should 
switch to TDF/3TC/DTG in second -line.  
HIV/HBV co -infected patients failing second -line ART should be discussed in the MDT and  
discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000.)  
9.2 Hepatitis C/HIV Co -infection  
In Kenya, the prevalence of HCV infection is high in PWID (estimated to be 12 -16%). The 
prevalence in the general population and among PLHIV is low (estimated to be < 3%), but likelyprevalence in the general population and among PLHIV is low (estimated to be < 3%), but likely 
to be higher in HIV infected PWID due to shared routes of transmission. HIV/ HCV co -infection is 
associated with  
• Rapid progression of liver fibrosis  
• Higher risk of deteriorating liver disease even in the pres ence of controlled HIV disease  
• Worsened hepatotoxicity as a result of ART and other drugs used in the treatment of 
comorbidities  
Thus, HIV -positive persons at risk of HCV co -infection should be identified and offered HCV 
treatment. The recent introduction of direct acting antiviral therapies (DAAs) for treatment of 
HCV has simplified the management of HIV/HCV co -infection, making it possible to manageHCV has simplified the management of HIV/HCV co -infection, making it possible to manage 
uncomplicated HIV/HCV infection safely even in primary care settings.  
However, treatment for H CV is a rapidly evolving field of therapeutics. Providers are encouraged 
to seek regular updates on the subject and, when in doubt, to discuss individual cases with 
experienced providers.  
9.2.1 Screening  
HCV serology should be offered to individuals at ri sk of HCV infection. These include  
● People who inject or use intranasal drugs  
● Persons who have had tattoos, body piercing or scarification procedures from 
settings with doubtful infection prevention precautions  
● Children born to HCV positive motherssettings with doubtful infection prevention precautions  
● Children born to HCV positive mothers  
Up to 30 % of individuals who are infected with HCV spontaneously clear the infection. To confirm 
chronic HCV infection, HCV positive individuals should be offered nucleic acid HCV RNA testing 
to establish presence of chronic HCV infection.Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults

Anxiety and other anxiety related disorders are mental health conditions that are often 
characterized by experiences of one or several of the following:  
− Feelings of nervousness  
− Fear, or worry that interfere with the ability to sleep or otherwise function  
− A lack of appetite  
− Tremulousness and or frank trembling  
− Sweating and clamminess  of hands  
− Other symptoms may include a racing heart (rapid heartbeat ), difficulty breathing,  
headaches, difficulty falling asleep, and difficulty concentrating.  
Concerns around anxiety, especially within the context of living with HIV or caring for persons 
living with HIV may reveal themselves during the history taking. These manifestations need to beliving with HIV may reveal themselves during the history taking. These manifestations need to be 
taken seriously and addressed with sincerity and compassion.  
Many of these may require basic reassurance and support or even just a listening ear during the 
evaluation session. These will go a long way in alleviating many patient’s anxieties and conc erns. 
A quick screening tool can be used to assess whether the anxiety demonstrated or identified may 
require further attention.  
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD -7) is a seven -item instrument that is used to 
measure or assess the severity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Each item asks the 
individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms over the past two weeks.HIV Testing Services and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention

1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, 
consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; 
https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform ). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the 
second -line ART. Add itional drugs may be recommended on a case -by-case basis, including DRV/r, 
ATV/r, RAL, or ETR  
2. Patients failing DTG -based or PI -based first -line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test 
(DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient  summary and DRT results 
should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWGshould be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG 
(https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform ) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the 
most suitable second -line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be us ed to determine if 
there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non -adherence. Daily 
witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT  
Important Considerations for First -line Treatment Failure in Children  
● Second -line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and 
their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule 
out inter -current illness or non -adherence as the reason for a high viral loadout inter -current illness or non -adherence as the reason for a high viral load  
● All c hildren failing first -line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an 
experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second -line. However, this should 
not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen  
● The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first -line regimen are limited 
and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of 
these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second -line regimen  
Important considerations for s econd -line ART Treatment Failure  
● Patients failing second -line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third -line● Patients failing second -line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third -line 
regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. 
These factors will exacerbate pre -existing poor adherence  
● Second -line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the 
viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6)  
o After the first detectable VL (  50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of 
poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.  
o These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months 
of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witn essed ingestion of the ARVs by a 
treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).  
o If the second VL is still  50 copies/ml then continue the failing second -line regimen 
while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence 
support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.  
o If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza 
Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform ) using the national 
case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for 
the TWG to design the most suitable third -line regimen  
● Patients failing second -line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence 
and ongoing enhanced adherence support including  
o Assigning a case managerand ongoing enhanced adherence support including  
o Assigning a case manager  
o More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor  
o Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders

hours cumulative haemodialysis  
 
C. Follow -up/Monitoring  
Follow -up of HIV/HBV co -infected patients should be as for all other patients on ART. However, 
consider more frequent monitoring (using ALT) for patients with active liver disease (jaundice,consider more frequent monitoring (using ALT) for patients with active liver disease (jaundice, 
liver cirrhosis and features of portal hypertension) at baseline.  The presence of co -infection also 
increases the risk of drug -related hepatotoxicity from all classes of ARVs by 3 -5 times, especially 
when anti -TB and ART are given simultaneously. Also, hepatic flare -up (AST > 5 times normal 
value) can occur, often in th e initial 3 months.  
Note:  ALT elevations 5 -10 times normal can be tolerated in the first 3 months of ART as 
long as the patient is not severely symptomatic, remains stable without progression, and 
there is no evidence of synthetic dysfunction (INR normal,  glucose normal, albumin 
normal).there is no evidence of synthetic dysfunction (INR normal,  glucose normal, albumin 
normal).  
Patients with persistently elevated ALT levels during follow -up should be referred to a 
specialist. Subsequent laboratory monitoring after baseline should be conducted every 6 
months. Patients should be counselled and supp orted to abstain from consuming alcohol.  
D. Stopping treatment, /treatment interruptions  
TDF -containing ART should not be stopped in a patient with HIV/HBV co -infection as this may 
result in a flare -up of the hepatitis. If the regimen must be stopped and another alternative for 
suppressing hepatitis B cannot be found, liver enzymes should be monitored and treatment re -
instated as soon as possible.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Home visit  Observe where and how a patient stores and takes 
their medications and assess if they have extra 
medications because of missed doses. Home visits 
may also provide a better understanding of a 
patient’s living situation and specific barriers to 
adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more 
revealing, but should only be conducted if the  patient 
consente d to home visits previously (preferably at 
the time of enrolment or initiation)  For patients with suspected or 
confirmed treatment failure, 
patients who default from care, 
or any time the MDT feels a 
home visit will contribute to 
patient managementor any time the MDT feels a 
home visit will contribute to 
patient management  
 
Accurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non -
judgmental relationship with patients.  This is best done when one provider follows an 
individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the 
specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in 
an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they 
believe the clinician wants to hear: perfe ct adherence.  
Every provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence inEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in 
assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients 
who do not have significant barriers to adherence . However, patients with significant adherence 
challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional 
training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving 
experienced colleagu es at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is 
identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as 
possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be require d 
for complex situations.Standard Package of Care for PLHIV

PHDP (Positive Health, Dignity and prevention) is a framework that emphasizes the health and 
rights of P LHIV, including reducing risk of onward transmission of HIV.  Within PHDP are 7 core 
domains of services that should be provided at the health facility to PLHIV and caregivers (Table

13 - 5 Annex 5: Age -Appropriate Disclosure for Children and Adolescents  
Age 
Characteristics  Stage of 
Disclosure  Provider Actions  
0 - 4 years  No disclosure  At this stage no disclosure is done since the child is too young 
to understand about HIV  
5 - 8 years  Partial disclosure  At this age the child can understand a lot. Define the virus as a 
germ and the CD4 as the soldier in the body that keeps fighting 
and one has to take the drugs to strengthen the soldiers in the 
body  
9 to 12 years  Full disclosure  Full disclosure is important since most children at this stage 
are able to understand more about HIV and would have heard 
about HIV as part of formal education at school  
Follow the following stages in the disclosure process  
Stage 1Follow the following stages in the disclosure process  
Stage 1  
Assessing the child’s social support system to ensure 
availability of sufficient support once disclosure is completed  
Stage 2  
Assess the child’s prior knowledge about HIV including 
information given at school, any myths and misconceptions. 
Offer or reinforce accurate information  
Stage 3  
Use an imaginary exercise or story to assess child’s reaction to 
disclosure of HIV status  
Stage 4  
Tell the child about their HIV status. Support parents to 
disclose to the child and clarify the mode of infect ion. Address 
immediate reactions and concerns a child might have

9 - 3 B. Recommended first -line ART in HIV/HBV co -infection  
The recommended first -line ART in adolescents and adults with HIV/HBV co -infection 
is TDF + 3TC + DTG, including for women and adolescent girls of childbearing potential  
 
Treatment with both TDF (or TAF) and 3TC is recommended as 3TC without TDF or TAF will 
result in rapid emergence of resistance. In case of renal impairment (as assessed by creatinine 
clearance), the dose of TDF and 3TC should be adjusted (Table 9.3).

6 - 19 Non -adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load 
monitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming 
treatment failure.  
Daily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm 
excellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before 
switching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the n ew regimen as well, and 
soon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is 
the primary cause of poor adherence  (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are notthe primary cause of poor adherence  (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not 
manageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom 
management), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence. 
This should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.

Pill counts  Ask the patient to bring all their pills with 
them to follow -up visits. Calculate how many 
pills should be remaining based on the 
previous prescription date and amount 
prescribed, and compare to how many pills 
are actually remaining. Excess pills are 
assumed to be missed doses. Use Table 5.13 to 
calculate adherence rate and take action as 
required  ● At every visit until confirmed 
viral suppression

women: at fir st ANC visit if 
already on ART, or 3 months 
after ART initiation if starting 
ART during pregnancy, and then 
every 6 monthsInitial Evaluation and Follow up  
3 - 9  3.5.1 First 6 months after ART initiation  
After ART initiation, patients need to be monitored closely for development of adverse drug events, 
identify and address barriers to adherence, and development of IRIS. A reasonable follow -up 
schedule for most patients is 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ART initiation (Table 3. 5 and 3. 6).  
When possi ble, follow -up for a particular patient should be provided by the same care provider or 
team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly 
important during the first 6 months in care.   
3.5.2 Differentiat ed Service Delivery for Patients beyond the 1st 6 months of ART3.5.2 Differentiat ed Service Delivery for Patients beyond the 1st 6 months of ART  
Follow up of patients beyond 6 months of ART is described in table 3. 5. It also  provides the criteria 
for determining if a patient is established on ART.  
In summary:  
● Patients who are not established on ART require closer follow -up.  
● Patients who are established on ART require less frequent facility follow -up, with up 
to six months b etween clinical appointments

1. As part of treatment preparation, patients should be informed that 
viral load is the recommended method of monitoring ART. VL results 
should always be discussed with patients, even when they are 
undetectable. Goals of treatment and definition of success should be 
discussed and adherence messaging reinforced 
2. Common causes of poor adherence include: stigma, non -disclosure, 
travel, toxicities, alcohol or drug use, mental health disorder, religious 
beliefs, inadequate treatment preparation, chaotic lifestyle, lack of 
support systems, and poor patient -provider relationship 
3. Other common causes of treatment failure (beyond adherence) 
include: inadequate dosing/dose adjustments, drug -druginclude: inadequate dosing/dose adjustments, drug -drug 
interactions, drug -food interactions, impaired absorption (e.g. 
chronic severe diarrhoea)

4 - 28  4.6.2 Alcohol and Drug Use/Addiction  
Alcohol and other drug use are common among the general population and among PLHIV. 
Alcohol and drug use can be a significant contributing factor to poor adherence and HIV 
treatment failure.  
All adults and adolescents should be screened for alcohol and drug use before initiating ART and 
every year using the following three questions:  
● During the past 12 months, did you  drink any alcohol (more than a few sips)?  
● During the past 12 months, did you smoke any marijuana?  
● During the past 12 months, did you use anything else to get high?  
Patients who answer “yes” to any of the questions above, and all patients with a detectable  viralPatients who answer “yes” to any of the questions above, and all patients with a detectable  viral 
load after 3 or more months on ART (whether or not they had achieved viral suppression in the 
past), should undergo a more thorough screening.  
For adolescents, use the CRAFFT screening tool (Table 4.1 6). For adults, use the CAGE -AID 
screening tool (Table 4.1 7). Anyone who screens positive on these tools should have further 
assessment and management by clinical staff, ideally with experience in managing alcohol and 
drug use disorders. Table 4.1 8 gives some general guidance on management of addictions . The 
National Protocol for Treatment of Substance Use Disorders in Kenya provides more in -depth 
guidance.   
Table 4.1 6: CRAFFT Screening Interview for Adolescentsguidance.   
Table 4.1 6: CRAFFT Screening Interview for Adolescents  
CRAFFT Screening for Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders for Adolescents  
Ask the patient the six questions below. Each question requires a yes/no response. Answering Yes to two 
or more questions indicates an alcohol or drug use problem and requires further assessment and 
management.  
“I’m going to ask you a few questions that I ask all my patients . Please be honest. I will keep your 
answers confidential”  
Question  No Yes 
1. Have you ever ridden in a Car driven by someone (including yourself) 
who was “high” or had been using alcohol or drugs?    
2. Do you ever use alcohol or drugs to Relax, feel better about yourself, or 
fit in?    
3. Do you ever use Alcohol or drugs while you are alone?fit in?    
3. Do you ever use Alcohol or drugs while you are alone?    
4. Do you ever Forget things you did while using alcohol or drugs?    
5. Do your Family or Friends ever tell you that you should cut down on 
your drinking or drug use?    
6. Have you ever gotten into Trouble while you were using alcohol or 
drugs?Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

All HIV infected patients who are co -infected with hepatitis B should be started on ART 
irrespective of CD4 cell count, WHO clinical stage or stage of liver disease  
 
The general recommendations for treatment preparation, adherence counselling and support 
and monitoring of therapy for PLHIV apply. However, because HBV positive patients are at higher 
risk of hepatotoxicity, closer monitoring of liver function (with ALT) is advised. Table 9.2 
provides a summary of areas of focus during initial evaluation for HIV/HBV co -infected patients

5.3 Adherence Monitoring, Counselling and Support During the First 3 Months 
of ART  
5.3.1 Adherence Monitoring  
Once ART has been initiated, adherence should be assessed non-judgmentally by a trained 
provider during each visit (Table 5.10).  The objectives of this assessment are to evaluate and 
reinforce the patient’s adherence to ART, to elicit any barriers to the same, and to develop a plan 
with the patient/caregiver to address any of the barriers identified. These may include incorrect 
knowledge of HIV infection and ART, unsupportive psychosocial factors, difficult home or schoolknowledge of HIV infection and ART, unsupportive psychosocial factors, difficult home or school 
environment, substance use and poor motivation for taking medication. Patients/caregivers ne ed 
to be counselled on the importance of being honest about their adherence in order for the 
healthcare team to serve them better.  
Adherence monitoring requires a combination of interventions. At every clinical visit, the MMAS -
4 should be administered as w ell as pill counts. MMAS -8 should be administered any time a 
healthcare worker suspects adherence problem (e.g., patients with suspected or confirmed 
treatment failure; patient who misses an appointment).Annexes

6 - 17 6.5.4 Changing ARVs Due to Treatmen t Failure  
Viral load is the test of choice for monitoring response to ART and identifying treatment failure. 
First VL should be performed 3 months after ART initiation for all PLHIV.   
Treatment failure should be suspected when a new or recurrent HIV -associ ated condition 
indicating severe immunodeficiency (WHO stage III or IV condition) develops after at least 6 
months on ART. Treatment failure should always be confirmed with VL testing.  
Frequency of routine VL monitoring for specific populations is:  
● Age 0-24 years old: at 3 months after ART initiation and then every 6 months  
● Age ≥ 25 years old: at 3 months after ART initiation, then at month 12 and then● Age ≥ 25 years old: at 3 months after ART initiation, then at month 12 and then 
annually  
● Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 
months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/ breastfeeding), and 
then every 6 months until cessation of breastfeeding  
● Before making any drug substitution (if no VL results from the prior 6 months)  
● Three months after any regimen modification (includin g single -drug substitutions), 
and then as per population group  
● For any patient with a detectable VL follow the viral load monitoring algorithm 
(Figure 6.6)  
 
Interpreting Viral Load Results and Defining Treatment Failure (Figure 6.6)  
The goal for ART is t o achieve sustained viral suppression defined as below the Lower DetectionThe goal for ART is t o achieve sustained viral suppression defined as below the Lower Detection 
Limit (LDL), < 50 copies/ml is considered as suppressed.  See Table 5.17  
Persistent low -level viremia (PLLV) is defined as having between 200 -999 copies/ml on 
two consecutive measures.  These patients are at increased risk of progression to treatment 
failure, development of resistance and death and therefore require a similar case management 
approach as patients with VL ≥ 1,000 copies/ml, and consultation with the Re gional or National 
HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform ).  
Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a high VL ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after at leastTreatment failure is suspected when a patient has a high VL ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after at least 
3 months of using ART.  Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after 
assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then repeating VL

Patients with mild depression should receive supportive counselling, which includes  
● Psycho -education on the following key messages  
o Depression is common and can happen to anyone  
o Depressed people often have exaggerated negative opinions about themselves, 
their life and their future  
o Effective treatment is possible  
● Counseling on self -management  
o Continuing ART as prescribed  
o Continuing activities that they used to find interesting/pleasurable  
o Maintaining a regular sleep cycle  
o Keeping physically active  
o Participating in community/social events  
o Returning to clinic if any thoughts of self -harm occur  
● Addressing psychosocial stressorso Returning to clinic if any thoughts of self -harm occur  
● Addressing psychosocial stressors  
o Explore potential stressors in the patient ’s life  
o Assist in problem -solving to reduce stressors  
o Assess for and manage intimate partner violence  
● Reactivation of or referral to social networks, including peer support groups  
● Regular follow -up until symptoms improves and are stable  
 
Pharmacological Management of Depression  
Patients with moderate depression or worse should be treated with supportive counselling plus 
an anti -depressant medication.  
Fluoxetine is an antidepressant and does not have significant drug interactions with ARVs.  
● Starting dose for an adult is usually 20 mg once taken daily in the morning (can start with a● Starting dose for an adult is usually 20 mg once taken daily in the morning (can start with a 
lower dose for patients who frequently have side -effects from medications). Dose can be 
titrated up by 20 mg every 2 -4 weeks as needed, up to a maximum of 80 mg p er day.  
● Common side -effects include GI upset, headaches, insomnia, and disturbances of the 
menstrual cycle. These usually resolve after 1 -2 weeks of continued use.  
● Full effect is not achieved until around 4 weeks of continued use. Once symptoms of 
depres sion resolve, antidepressants should be continued for at least another 6 months.  
● If/when the patient is ready to discontinue antidepressant therapy it should be discontinued● If/when the patient is ready to discontinue antidepressant therapy it should be discontinued 
as a weekly taper (e.g., if the maintenance dose is 60mg then taper to 40mg, then 30mg, then 
20mg, then 10mg and then stop), with close monitoring for recurrence of symptoms.TB/HIV Co -infection, Prevention and Management  
 
9 - 1  
9. HBV/HIV and HCV/HIV Co -infection 
Prevention and Management  
9.1 Hepatitis B/HIV Co -infection  
HIV and Hepatitis -B Virus (HBV) share infection transmission routes.  Acute HBV infection in HIV 
positive people is associated with increased risk of chronicity, reduced chances of spontaneous 
clearance, higher rates of replication and reactivation and therefore increased incidence of 
chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hep atocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, HIV/HBV co -
infection has been associated with rapid HIV disease progression and poorer HIV treatment 
outcomes.  Other complications of HIV/HBV co -infection include increased incidence of drug -outcomes.  Other complications of HIV/HBV co -infection include increased incidence of drug -
related hepatotoxicit y, drug -drug interactions and ART -related immune reconstitution hepatitis.  
9.1.1 Screening  
All adolescents and adults living with HIV (plus children who did not complete routine childhood 
immunizations) should be screened for HBV infection, using HBsAg, as part of initial evaluation. 
To promote population -wide prevention, hepatitis B prevention should be integrated into 
routine HIV prevention and care programs. In this setting, other indications for HBsAg screening 
could include  
▪ Household and sexual contacts of HBsAg positive individuals  
▪ Pregnant women  
▪ Persons who inject drugs (PWID)  
▪ Men who have sex with men  
▪ Sex workers▪ Persons who inject drugs (PWID)  
▪ Men who have sex with men  
▪ Sex workers  
▪ Persons with multiple sexual partners  
▪ Prisoners  
▪ Blood donors  
▪ Unvaccinated healthcare providers  
 
PLHIV on follow -up who presen t with signs of liver disease (jaundice, ascites, abnormal liver on 
palpation, other signs of cirrhosis) or unexplained and persistent ALT elevation should also be 
screened for HBV as part of their work -up. 
9.1.2 Prevention  
A. Vaccination : HBV vaccination reduces the risk of new (incident) HBV infection in PLHIV and 
also reduces the risk of new infections becoming chronic. Therefore;  
● HIV positive infants, children, adolescents and adults without evidence of hepatitis B 
infection (HBsAg negative)  should be vaccinated against hepatitis B (Table 9.1)infection (HBsAg negative)  should be vaccinated against hepatitis B (Table 9.1)  
● HIV exposed infants (HEI) should also receive hepatitis B vaccination as part of childhood 
immunization (Table 4.21)  
● As a strategy to reduce the population level burden of HBV infection, HIV prevention and 
treatment settings should integrate HBV prevention through vaccination. Thus, HBV 
vaccination is recommended for the following groups who test HBsAg negative.Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support

symptom groups concurrently  
• Fever  
• Erythematous and/or pruritic rash  
• Respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath and/or sore throat and/or cough)  
• GI symptoms: nausea and/or vomiting and/or diarrhea  
• Extreme fatigue and/or body pain preventing normal activities  
AND: there is not a more likely alternative explanation for the symptoms  
Management  
• Stop ABC immediately and substitute with an alternative ARV  
• Patient must NEVER be re -challenged with ABC – a single dose could result in a fatal 
hypersensitivity reactionhypersensitivity reaction  
• Clearly mark file and educate patient about avoiding ABC in future  
• Issue an Adverse Event alert card

Kenya is committed to achieving the UNAIDS 95 –95–95 testing and treatment targets among 
people living with HIV within all sub -populations and age groups.  
The 2022 edition of the ‘Guidelines on Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating and Pr eventing 
HIV Infection in Kenya’ is an update of the comprehensive HIV prevention, Care and treatment 
guidelines released in 2018. These guidelines are aligned with the Ministry of Health’s mission of 
providing the highest standard of health for all Kenyan s and one of the Government of Kenya’s Big 
Four Agenda on Universal Health Coverage .  
The theme of the 2022 guidelines is refocusing efforts in the management of Advanced HIV 
Disease to reduce HIV/AIDS related morbidity and mortality. While Kenya has made tremendousDisease to reduce HIV/AIDS related morbidity and mortality. While Kenya has made tremendous 
progress in HIV Prevention, Care and Treatment through introduction of better medicines, 
diagnostics and patient centered approaches in service delivery, Advanced HIV Disease continues 
to be a challenge. These guidelines intend to widen access t o key diagnostics and medicines to 
manage the most common causes of illness and death. Further, emphasis on integrated delivery 
of patient -centered HIV, TB, NCDs, mental health and sexual and reproductive health services has 
been included.  
These guidelines  provide key recommendations on  HIV testing services and linkage to prevention 
and treatment; initial evaluation and follow up of PLHIV; standard package of care for PLHIV;and treatment; initial evaluation and follow up of PLHIV; standard package of care for PLHIV; 
adherence preparation monitoring and support; antiretroviral therapy in infants, c hildren, 
adolescents and adults; prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV, Syphilis and Viral 
Hepatitis; TB/HIV coinfection; Hepatitis B & C/HIV co -infection; use of ARVs for post and pre -
exposure prophylaxis for HIV uninfected populations; and HI V services for people who inject 
drugs.  
The guidelines are an important tool meant to be used by service providers at all levels of the 
health sector in Kenya. They are presented in a simplified manner using a public health approach 
to HIV prevention and treatment.to HIV prevention and treatment.  
It is my hope that this guidance document provides the much -needed framework and impetus to 
move towards universal access for HIV services and the agenda of ending AIDS by 2030 as a key 
national health strategic objective.

2 - 2  2.1.2 Community –based t esting  
Targeted community based HTS offers additional opportunities to identify and link people to HIV 
treatment and prevention. This setting is especially important for testing children and partners of 
index clients through index testing , as well as  outreach to key and priority populations, orphans, 
and vulnerable children (OVCs), adolescents, youth and targeted testing in workplaces.  
2.2 HTS strategies  
The major HTS strategies to identify people living with HIV but unaware of their status are:  
2.2.1 HIV Self -Testing (HIVST)  
● HIVST allows individuals to collect their own specimen, perform the test, and interpret the● HIVST allows individuals to collect their own specimen, perform the test, and interpret the 
results on their own, conducted either within a health facility, at home or in any other 
convenient place.  
HIVST can be  conducted with o r without direct assistance by a trained person.  
● HIVST is a screening test and is not sufficient to make an HIV -positive diagnosis. A reactive 
(positive) self -test result should therefore be confirmed using the validated national testing 
algorithm by an H TS-trained service provider.  
● HIVST should be performed using MoH approved HIV rapid diagnostic test kits that are either 
blood -based or oral fluid based.  
● HIVST may have the greatest benefit in reaching specific populations such as partners of newly● HIVST may have the greatest benefit in reaching specific populations such as partners of newly 
diagnosed PLHIV; partners of pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC); contacts of 
patients treated for STIs; hard -to-reach populations such as men, adolescents, and young 
people, as well as key populations, such as MSM and sex workers.  
HIVST is a scr eening test and does not provide a diagnosis.  
All reactive (positive) self -test results must be confirmed in a health facility according to 
nationally set standards  
2.2.2 Index Testing  referred to as partner testing/partner notification services, is an approach 
whereby the exposed contacts (i.e., sexual partners, biological children and anyone with whom awhereby the exposed contacts (i.e., sexual partners, biological children and anyone with whom a 
needle was shared) of an HIV -positive person (i.e., index client), are elicited and offered HIV testing 
services  
2.2.3 Voluntary Counselling and Testin g (VCT):  This involves provision of targeted HIV 
testing to clients who willingly present to HTS facilities for testing for diverse reasons, including 
self-assessed risk.  
2.2.4 Social Network Strategy (SNS) - this involves offering to index clients self -guided options 
to informally extend links to HIV testing and other services to a broader set of social -, sexual -, 
and injecting -network members who have an elevated risk of HIV infection. The index client forand injecting -network members who have an elevated risk of HIV infection. The index client for 
SNS can either be PLHIV or HIV negative persons wi th increased risk for HIV infection . 
Providing targeted HTS for different populations and in different settings increases opportunities 
for access to knowledge of HIV status and to a range of HIV treatment and prevention services.

(Figure 2.2)  ● Birth testing (HIV testing of infants at birth or at first contact within 2 weeks after 
birth) can be conducted where feasible and in settings wher e return of results is 
feasible within 24 hours and ART  can be initiated immediately*). Infants tested at 
birth must be tested at the 6 weeks immunization visit regardless of the results of 
the initial test at birth.

Infants and 
children aged less 
than 18 months 
(Figure 2.1)  ● HIV exposure status of all infants should be established at first contact.  
● To establish HIV exposure status of a child less than 18 months of age, conduct HIV 
antibody testing for mothers with unknown status or who previously tested 
negative during antenatal care at the 6 -week immunization visit or first contact. If 
the mother declines to be tested or is not available for testing, then conduct a rapid 
HIV antibo dy test for the child to determine exposure (if antibody test is positiveHIV antibo dy test for the child to determine exposure (if antibody test is positive 
this confirms HIV exposure)  
● When HIV exposure is confirmed, ARV prophylaxis should be started immediately.  
● All HEIs should have DNA PCR testing at the 6 -week immunization visit or fi rst 
contact thereafter.  
● Infants with an initial positive HIV DNA PCR result should be presumed to be HIV 
infected and started on ART in line with national guidelines, with a new sample for 
confirmatory HIV DNA PCR and baseline viral load taken at the time of ART

4.6 Mental Health Screening and Management  
PLHIV are susceptible to psychological disturbances due to HIV itself and perceptions regarding 
HIV in their environment. Some of the most common psychological disturbances include 
depression and suicide, anxiety, internalized stigma, post -traumatic stress disorder, cognitivedepression and suicide, anxiety, internalized stigma, post -traumatic stress disorder, cognitive 
difficulties such as dementia, and perceived lack of social support. Any of these can significantly 
interfere with a patient’s sense of well -being and their adherence. Depression and alcohol/drug 
addiction are the most significant and are reviewed in this sect ion. For any patient with other 
suspected mental health disorders, such as anxiety, psychosis or post -traumatic stress disorder, 
consider formal screening and/or referral to a specialist.  
4.6.1 Depression  
Depression is one of the most common psychiatric il lnesses in the world, and chronic illness 
(including HIV) is a strong risk factor for depression. PLHIV are 3 -6 times more likely to suffer(including HIV) is a strong risk factor for depression. PLHIV are 3 -6 times more likely to suffer 
from depression than the general population, with significant disability and poorer treatment 
outcomes if it is not identified and managed. Depression can be a significant contributing factor 
to poor adherence and HIV treatment failure.  
All PLHIV should receive basic screening for depression upon enrollment and thereafter 
annually using the following two questions:  
● Duri ng the past two weeks have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or 
hopeless?  
● During the past two weeks have you often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in 
doing things?  
All patients who answer “yes” to either or both of the questi ons above, and all patients with aAll patients who answer “yes” to either or both of the questi ons above, and all patients with a 
detectable viral load after 3 or more months on ART (whether or not they had achieved viral 
suppression in the past), should undergo a more thorough screening for depression using the 
PHQ -9 screening tool, with management  guided by the PHQ -9 score (Table 4.1 5).Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support

corrected.  
● Avoid the use of TDF in patients with CrCl < 50ml/min unless in HIV/HBV coinfection (in which case 
TAF or TDF should be used). For patients wit h HBV co -infection, the benefit of TDF or TAF for treating 
HBV often outweighs the risks of renal impairment, so more severe levels of renal impairment are 
tolerated. See Table 9.3 for TDF and TAF dose adjustments for patients with HBV/HIV co -infection.tolerated. See Table 9.3 for TDF and TAF dose adjustments for patients with HBV/HIV co -infection.

Four interventions are important f or cancer control among PLHIV:  
● Achieve viral suppression:  uncontrolled viral replication is a major risk factor for 
cancer. All PLHIV should initiate ART, and be supported and monitored to achieve long -
term viral suppression in order to reduce risk for can cer, and to improve treatment 
outcomes for many cancers  
● Primary prevention through avoidance of modifiable risk factors  
o Smoking cessation  
o Avoidance of harmful use of alcohol  
o Regular physical activity  
o Healthy diets  
o Vaccination: vaccination against Human Papillomavirus for girls 9 -14 years old areo Vaccination: vaccination against Human Papillomavirus for girls 9 -14 years old are 
eligible in Kenya, Hepatitis B Vaccine for newborns and high -risk groups  
● Secondary prevention through screening and early diagnosis  
o Screening: application of simple tests to detect cancer in asymptomatic individuals  
▪ Cervical cancer: all women LHIV who have been sexually active up to 49 years 
old (25 -49 years in the general population), through either visual inspection 
with acetic acid (VIA) or PAP smear annually, or HPV testing every 2 years  
▪ Breast cancer: mammogram annually from 40 -55 years; mammogram every 
two years from 56 -74 years; screening for younger women can be performed 
on an individual basis based on family history or other risk factors. Clinicalon an individual basis based on family history or other risk factors. Clinical 
breast exam can be used where mammogr am is not available  
▪ Prostate cancer: serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) annually for men 40 
years and above; digital rectal examination can be used if PSA is not available, 
and for all men with urinary symptoms  
▪ Colorectal cancer: fecal occult blood test ing of stool (guaiac or FIT) annually for 
everyone 45 -75 years old, or colonoscopy every 10 years  
▪ Oral cancer: visual examination for everyone above 40 years with history of 
tobacco use, known HPV infection or immunosuppression

11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility  
To be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment 
must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.  
● Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.  
● Determine if the client is w illing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence● Determine if the client is w illing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence

Other important factors  for screening  
1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening:  All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for 
gender -based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate 
intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.  
2. Mental Status Assessment:  Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be 
assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and 
offer appropriate referral as necessary.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022  
3 - 6  3.4 Management of Patients Who Present with Advanced HIV Disease  
The World hea lth organization (WHO) defines AHD for adults, adolescents, and children five years 
and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO clinical stage III or IV 
disease. All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not al ready receiving ART and 
not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.  
Advanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, 
those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienc ed 
treatment failure.  
PLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infectionsPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections 
(OI), other infectious and non -infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity 
and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health -care costs, use of more health -care 
services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD 
include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial 
infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii 
pneumonia amongst others.  
CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:   
• New clients initiating ART:  
o CD4 testing should be c onducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIVo CD4 testing should be c onducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV  
• Patients who are treatment experienced:  
o PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 
months).  
o Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL 
>1,000 within 3 -6 months).  
Package of Care for AHD  
All PLHIV presenting  with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that 
includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of 
opportunistic infections.  
Table 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care

● Access for HIV testing and STI/HIV prevention interventions should be reinforced for 
partners of pregnant and breastfee ding womenpartners of pregnant and breastfee ding women  
● Mothers who are diagnosed with HIV while breastfeeding should immediately start 
appropriate ART, giving extra attention to adherence support, VL monitoring, and optimal 
retention in care. The infant should immediately start ARV prophylaxis and r eceive PCR 
testing (Table 7.3).  
● Mothers who decide to stop breastfeeding at any time should stop gradually within one 
month (and only when a nutritionally adequate and safe diet without breast milk can be 
sustained), and HIV positive mothers and HIV positi ve infants should continue with ART. 
Continued breastfeeding is recommended for HIV positive infants for as long as the 
mother is willing and able to do so.mother is willing and able to do so.  
● In special medical circumstances, determined by clinicians, where an infant cannot 
breastfeed, refe r to current MIYCN Policy and Breast Milk Substitute (BMS) Regulation 
and Control Act, 2012.  
● Complimentary feeding means giving other foods to complement breast milk after six

TDF + 3TC + ATV/r may be offered as an alternative where DTG cannot be used. 
(Table 6.3)  
TB Co -infecti on  ART should be started as soon as possible within two weeks of initiating TB 
treatment, regardless of CD4 cell count.treatment, regardless of CD4 cell count.  
For PWID with TB/HIV co -infection on DTG, give TDF/3TC/DTG FDC given in 
the am + DTG 50mg given in the pm for duration of rifampicin -containing TB 
treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then 
revert to TDF/3TC/DTG FDC once daily.  
Second -line 
ART  Patients failing DTG -based first line ART (including PWID) should be managed 
as per the viral load  monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6), including performing a 
DRT for selection of a second -line regimen (Table 6.10)  
Treatment preparation 
and adherence 
counselling and 
support  Injection drug use is not a contra -indication to ART initiation. OST, though 
imp ortant in contributing to the success of ART in PWID, should not be a pre -imp ortant in contributing to the success of ART in PWID, should not be a pre -
requisite to initiation of ART. However, these patients benefit from additional 
preparation and support to increase their chances of successful treatment 
including:  
● Harm reduction in terventions  
● Thorough baseline assessment for important comorbid conditions like 
Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) including TB, hepatitis, renal impairment 
and depression or other psychiatric disorders  
● Negotiation for, and access to daily witnessed ingestion (DWI ).

Screening  
● Urinalysis (for protein) and serum creatinine should be evaluated at baseline for all PLHIV and 
monitored annually  
Diagnosis  
● Impaired renal function is defined as creatinine clearance < 90 ml/min, or dipstick proteinuria ≥ 1 
(see Annex 15 for CrCl calculations)  
● Abnormal results should be repeated to confirm diagnosis  
● Chronic kidney disease is defined as evidence of kidney damage that persists for at least three 
months  
Management  
● Management depends on the cause of the renal impairment; additional investigations and/or 
specialist consultation may be required  
● Consultations with a physician is recommendedspecialist consultation may be required  
● Consultations with a physician is recommended  
● Treat dehydration promptly and aggressively  
● If on TDF -containing regimen, substitute with another ARV if C rCl<50 ml/min (see Section 6.5), 
with the exception of patients with HBV/HIV co -infection (Table 9.3 for renal dose adjustments of 
TDF and 3TC for patients with HIV/HBV co -infection)  
● Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides and NSAIDS)  
● Evaluate for a nd treat hypertension  
● All NRTIs except ABC require dose adjustments for renal impairment, depending on the severity 
(Table 6.6 for specific dose adjustments). NNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs do not require dose adjustments

Note: DTG may  cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a 
decline in renal function, close monitoring is recommended.  
Patients at higher risk for renal disease and for developing TDF -associated renal toxicity include 
those with: pre-existing renal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, severe wasting (weight 
below 60 kg in adults), age > 45 years, WHO stage 3 or 4, CD4 < 200 cells/mm3, high HIV viral 
load, and concomitant nephrotoxic agents.  
Glomerular disease directly related to HIV infection, commonly known as HIV -associated 
nephropathy (HIVAN) is an important cause of chronic kidney disease among PLHIV.

the burden of dialysis and other c omplications.  
4.5.2 Cancer Prevention, Early Detection and Management among PLHIV  
PLHIV have a substantially higher risk for many cancers, mainly due to a weakened immune 
system which impairs control of oncogenic viral infections. A high prevalence of thes e infections 
and other modifiable risk factors (such as smoking, alcohol use, unhealthy diet and physical 
inactivity) contributes to the elevated risk. PLHIV are far more likely than the general population 
to be diagnosed with Kaposi Sarcoma, non -Hodgkin l ymphoma and other cancers (cervical, anal, 
liver, lung and oral/throat) hence the importance of prioritizing screening and early diagnosisliver, lung and oral/throat) hence the importance of prioritizing screening and early diagnosis

to be addressed for caregivers, children and adolescents (Table 5.6).HIV Testing Services and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention  
2 - 1   
2. HIV Testing Services and Linkage to Treatment 
and Prevention  
HIV testing services (HTS) provide the first critical link to comprehensive HIV treatment and 
prevention services such as voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), pre -exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP), post -exposure prophylaxis (P EP) and other combination HIV prevention 
services. In addition, this initial step also provides opportunities to offer other interventions such 
as sexual and reproductive health services (SRH), TB screening and referral, and substance abuse 
screening and r eferral.  
HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where the six CsHIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where the six Cs 
principles of Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) to care and 
other appropriate post -test services and creating an  enabling environment are adhered to . 
Targeted HIV testing  is the major strategic shift, involving index client listing of contacts, HIV self -
testing and use of HIV screening tools to identify people at risk of HIV infection as eligible for 
testing, except in the case of PMTCT and key populations.  
2.1 Settings fo r HIV Testing  
In Kenya, HTS is delivered in two broad settings: facility -based and community -based settings  
2.1.1 Facility -based testing2.1.1 Facility -based testing  
● The HTS screening tool should be used to facilitate prioritization of testing for persons at risk 
of HIV infection; those diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections, with multiple sexual 
partners, key populations, and those with possible or known HIV exposures, such as sexual or 
needle sharing partner of a person living with HIV or of a person of unknown HIV status  
● Providers should undertake a thorough risk assessment using the validated NASCOP screening 
tools (Annex 17) to identify clients at risk and those eligible for a HIV test.  
● HTS should be offered only to clients who consent  
● Clients who are not eli gible for testing should receive HIV prevention messages and be offered 
services as appropriateservices as appropriate  
● Clients who test HIV positive should be linked to care while those who test negative should be 
linked to HIV prevention services  
● Patients starting HIV care shou ld receive disclosure counselling and support, and be offered 
family, sexual and needle -sharing partner testing  
As much as possible, HIV testing services should be integrated into care pathways at all service 
delivery points including adult and pediatric i npatient units, outpatient units, maternal and child 
health clinics, SRH/family planning clinics, TB clinics, specialty clinics, gender -based violence 
(GBV) care units and service delivery points for key and priority populations.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

having experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime.  To identify these survivors 
screening is recommended. WHO recommends that facilities should meet the minimum 
requirement before starting to routinely screening clients.  
The minimum require ments are:   
• A protocol or Standard Operating Procedure exists for providing post -GBV and Violence 
Against Children  servicesAgainst Children  services  
• A questionnaire, with standard questions where providers can document responses,  
• Providers offer first -line support (LIVES)  
• Providers have received training on how to ask about GBV and Violence Against Children  
• Private setting, confidentiality ensured  
• A system for referrals or linkages to other services within the facility is in place  
If any of these minimum requirements is mis sing, GBV and Violence Against Children  services are 
considered inadequate, and providers should ensure to have these systems in place before 
conducting routine enquiry or universal screening  
All clients accessing HIV care services should be screened for a ny form of violence 
including  IPV as part of the standard package of care for PLHIV.including  IPV as part of the standard package of care for PLHIV.  
The following script can be used for screening:  
 “Many people do not realize that violence can lead to various serious health problems. Many 
people have problems with thei r husbands, partners or other people in their lives. Sometimes the 
people who love us can hurt us. Has this ever happened to you?”  
Has your partner ever:  
1. Insulted you or made you feel bad about yourself?  
2. Belittled or humiliated you in front of other people?   
3. Did things to scare or intimidate you on purpose  
4. Threatened to hurt you or someone you care about?  
5. Slapped you or thrown something at you that could hurt you?  
6. Kicked, dragged, beat you up?  
7. Chocked or  burned you on purpose?6. Kicked, dragged, beat you up?  
7. Chocked or  burned you on purpose?  
8. Threatened to use or actually used a gun, knife or other weapon against you?  
9. Physically forced you to have sexual intercourse when you did not want?  
10. Did you ever have sexual intercourse you did not want because you were afraid of w hat 
he might do?  
11. Forced you to do something sexual that you found degrading or humiliating?

Prevention, vaccination, 
diagnosis, and treatment for 
viral hepatitis  Hepatitis B and C disproportionately affect PWID due to overlapping risk 
factors of sexual transmission and sharing needles, syringes, and other 
drug use items.  
Harm reduction and behavioral interv entions are also effective in 
reducing risk of infection/transmission of HBV and HCV.  
● Peer interventions should be offered to people who inject drugs to 
reduce the incidence of viral hepatitis  
● PWID should be screened for HBV (by HBsAg) and HCV (by HCV 
sero logy) at first contact  
● Hepatitis B  
o Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for those who are 
HBsAg negative. A higher -dose HBV vaccine should be usedHBsAg negative. A higher -dose HBV vaccine should be used 
with the rapid regimen (day 0, 7, 21, and a booster at 12 
months). If the rapid regimen is not available, the standard 
regimen should be offered. For PWID who are HIV positive, they 
should follow the dosing schedule in Table. 9.1  
o HBV/HIV co -infected PWID should be started on TDF - or TAF - 
containing ART (the current recommended first line is 
TDF/3TC/ DTG) in addition to harm -reduction interventions to 
optimize adherence and treatment outcomes.  
● Hepatitis C  
o HCV/HIV co -infected PWID should be initiated on ART.  
o Specific HCV antiviral therapy should be provided in 
consultation with expertise in the management of HCV infection 
(refer to national guidelines on management of viral hepatitis)(refer to national guidelines on management of viral hepatitis)  
  
Needle and syringe 
programmes (NSPs)  NSPs help decrease drug -related risk behaviors, reduce quantity of 
contaminated needles in circulation, reduce risk of new HIV infections and 
improve referrals and linkage to HTS and HIV treatment and prevention 
services.  
NSPs are effective means for intr oducing combination prevention to PWID 
including HTS, STI screening and treatment, condoms provision, OST, and 
HIV treatment and prevention.  
All PWID should be linked to NSPs to access sterile injecting 
equipment  
 
Opioid substitution therapy 
(OST)  OST usi ng methadone or another suitable alternative is effective in the 
treatment of opioid dependency, reducing risk behaviors related to drugtreatment of opioid dependency, reducing risk behaviors related to drug 
use and therefore reducing HIV transmission and improving PWIDs’

4 - 21  Table 4.1 2: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Screening, Diagnosis, and Initial Management for PLHIV  
Screening  
● Blood glucose (fasting or random) should be evaluated at baseline for all PLHIV, then annually if 
baseline screening is normal; urine dipstick for protein and glucose can be used if blood glucose 
testing is not available  
Diagnosis  
● Diabetes Mellitus is defined as fasting blood sugar ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, or random blood sugar ≥ 11.1 
mmol/L, or HbA1c > 6.5%, or oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 11.1 mmol/L  
● Abnormal results should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis, particularly for patients without 
symptoms of diabetes (such as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss)symptoms of diabetes (such as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss)  
 
Management (treatment target is HbA1c ≤ 7.0% or FBS 4 -7 mmol/L)  
● For patients with pre -diabetes (abnormal results but does not meet criteria above for diabetes) 
monitor FBS or HbA1c every 3 months and encourage lifestyle modifications (Table 4. 10) 
 
● For patients with diabetes, monitor HbA1c (or FBS if HbA1c is not available) every 3 months  
 
● Lifestyle modification (weight loss, nutritional support to manage portion sizes and calculate 
glycaemic index of various foods to hel p with control of blood sugar) for 3 -6 months  
 
● If does not meet treatment target with lifestyle modifications then add drugs  
o Metformin● If does not meet treatment target with lifestyle modifications then add drugs  
o Metformin  
▪ Obtain baseline Creatinine; do NOT use metformin if creatinine clearance < 45 ml/min  
▪ Start with low dose (500 mg OD or BD) and titrate up every 1 -2 weeks until reaches 1 g BD (or 
maximum tolerated dose if less than 1 g BD)  
▪ Note:  DTG may increase metformin plasma levels: monitor blood glucose levels; dose reduction 
of metformin may be required, and maximum daily dose of met formin should be 1g  
o If does not meet treatment targets with metformin for 3 -6 months at maximum tolerated dose then 
consider adding drug from another class (such as sulphonylureas (gliclazide)) and/or specialist 
consultation. Some patients may require insu lin.consultation. Some patients may require insu lin. 
o At every visit: A thorough history (to elicit features of hypoglycemia, other cardiovascular disease 
risk factors, neuropathy, diabetic foot ulcers) and a physical exam (for BP, neuropathy, foot ulcers)  
 
● Additional routine screening for patients with diabetes  
o Annual ophthalmology examination for diabetic retinopathy  
o Annual urinalysis: start on an ACE -I/ARB if proteinuria develops (even if BP normal)  
Note : patients with DM are at increased risk of developing TBTB/HIV Co -infection, Prevention and Management  
 
8 - 13 8.3.3 Management of TPT -associated Rash - Suspected Drugs include Isoniazid (H), 
Rifapentin e (P), Rifampicin (R)  
● A rash may occasionally develop, usually within a few days following initiation of TPT. It 
is often a relatively mild maculopapular rash with or without pruritus.  
● Flu-like and other systemic hypersensitivity reactions are rare amongst children. 
Hypersensitivity reactions in adults are usually mild and self -limiting  
● Rarely, rash may develop with severe exfoliation of the skin and Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome  
● Rash severity should be assessed and managed appropriately as shown in table  8.5

8.4. ART for TB/HIV Co -infection  
As with all PLHIV, those who are diagnosed with TB/HIV co -infection should be on ART and CPT 
as part of the comprehensive package of care for PLHIV.  
Timing of ART for TB/HIV Co -infection  
● Patients who are not yet on ART  
o Start TB treatment immediately  
o Initiate ART as soon as anti -TB medications are tolerated, preferably within 2 
weeks  
o For TB meningitis delay ART for 4 to 8 weeks  
o Monitor closely for IRIS (Annex 16)Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support  
5 - 13 5.2.3 Age -Specific Treatment Preparation and Support  
Treatment preparation must be customized to the patient’s age, gender, needs and clinical status: 
for patients who present with advanced/symptomatic disease, the focus is on getting better; for 
patients who present clinically well, the focus is on staying healthy. Specific needs for children, 
adolescents, caregivers, pregnant and breastfeeding women and men should also be taken into 
consideration.  
The HIV education and counselling sessions should be provided at every visit until the patient is 
ready and wi lling to start ART, as determined using the ART Readiness Assessment Form (Tableready and wi lling to start ART, as determined using the ART Readiness Assessment Form (Table 
5.4). Each repeat session should begin with a review of what the patient remembers from the 
previous session as well as any key issues the counsellor documented in the patient ’s chart, so the 
session can be customized to meet their needs. ART preparation should not take more than 1 -2 
weeks except for special circumstances such as with uncontrolled mental health issues or 
untreated drug addictions. However, once the patient has initiated ART, continued HIV education, 
counselling and adherence support must be provided. The counselling sessions should preferably 
be conducted by the same counsellor, peer educator, social worker, nurse, community healthbe conducted by the same counsellor, peer educator, social worker, nurse, community health 
volunteer, and/or clinician wh o is professionally certified to counsel based on a certified 
curriculum, and they possess the requisite competencies to provide quality counselling. In order 
to prepare children and adolescents for ART, the counsellor should be trained in providing 
psycho social support to this age group.

 12 - 2 Table 12.1: Comprehensive Package of Harm Reduction for PWID  
Intervention  Comment/Recommendations  
HIV testing services  PWID are at high risk of HIV infection, are likely to be diagnosed late and 
therefore have poorer treatment outcomes following ART i nitiation.  
● PWID should be offered HIV testing and counselling and be linked to 
comprehensive HIV treatment and prevention services including 
harm reduction counselling and support.  
● Retest for HIV every 3 months if there is ongoing risk.  
● HIV self -testing should be integrated into drop -in centers (DICEs) 
through both assisted and non -assisted approaches after initial 
testing by a provider.  
● HTS should also be offered to sexual partners  of PWID.testing by a provider.  
● HTS should also be offered to sexual partners  of PWID.   
 
Targeted information, 
education, and 
communication for PWID 
and their sexual partners  PWID and sexual partners should be provided with information and 
counselling on risks related to drug use and risky sexual behavior. PWID 
should be informed of where and what harm -reduction services are 
available, and linked to appropriate services.  
Peer -based networks are effective in improving access and retention to 
harm reduction care  
 
 
Condom provision  The correct and consistent use of condoms with condom -compatible 
lubricants is recommended for all PWID to prevent unintended pregnancy 
and sexual transmission of HIV and other STIs.  
 
 
Prevention and treatment of 
sexually transmittedPrevention and treatment of 
sexually transmitted 
infections  PWID may be at higher risk of STIs due to sex work or other risky sex 
practices.  
STIs, especially genital ulcer diseases increase the risk of HIV infection and 
transmission and are often a sign of unsafe sexual behavior or risk of HIV 
transmission.  
Screening, dia gnosis, treatment, and prevention of STIs should be offered 
routinely as part of comprehensive HIV prevention and care for PWID.  
 
 
Prevention, diagnosis, and 
treatment of TB  Independent of HIV infection, PWID have an increased risk of TB. HIV 
infection f urther increases this risk.  
● All PWID should be screened regularly for active TB using the 
symptom -based screening algorithm at each contact with healthcare 
workers.symptom -based screening algorithm at each contact with healthcare 
workers.  
● Once active TB is ruled out, TPT should be provided to PWID living 
with HIV as per National guidelines for TPT.  
● PWID w ith active TB should receive standard TB treatment as per the 
National guidelines and be supported to complete treatment.  
● Anticipate and manage complications due to viral hepatitis or renal 
impairment.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Management (treatment target is BP < 140/90 mmHg)  
● If baseline BP is 120 -139/80 -89 (pre -hypertension)  
o Lifestyle modification, along with monthly BP monitoring  
 
● If baseline BP is 140 -159/90 -99 
o Lifestyle modification (Table 4.9) for up to 6 months, along with monthly BP monitoring  
o If does not meet treatment target with lifestyle modifications, then add drugs to lifestyle 
modification  
o In PLHIV without  kidney disease or diabetes, first -line antihypertensive therapy is a thiazide 
diuretic s uch as hydrochlorothiazide starting at 12.5 mg OD (maximum dose 25 mg OD) OR a 
calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine starting at 2.5 mg OD (maximum 10 mg OD)calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine starting at 2.5 mg OD (maximum 10 mg OD)  
o In PLHIV with kidney disease or diabetes the first antihypertensive should be an ACE -I or ARB  
such as enalapril 2.5 -10 mg OD (maximum dose is 20 mg BD); or, losartan 50 mg OD (maximum 
dose is 100 mg OD), with referral to a physician if available  
o Introduce one drug at a time. If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after 
initia ting therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased. Titrate to maximum 
recommended dosage (if tolerated) before adding an additional drug  
o If inadequate response once dose has been titrated, an additional agent may be required e.g., 
hydr ochlorothiazide starting at 12.5 mg OD (maximum dose 25 mg OD)hydr ochlorothiazide starting at 12.5 mg OD (maximum dose 25 mg OD)  
o If inadequate response to two agents, consider consultation with or referral to a physician  
o Note: Calcium -channel blockers have known drug interactions with PIs and NNRTIs and 
should be used with caution (Annex 13). ACE -I and thiazide diuretics do not have significant 
interactions with ARVs  
 
● If baseline BP ≥ 160/100 mmHg  
o Initiate lifestyle modifications and introduce anti -hypertensive medications concurrentlyKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Rifapentine (P), Rifampicin (R)  
● Elevation of liver enzymes may occur in the first weeks of treatment  
● In asymptomatic patients, serum liver enzyme lev els do not need to be monitored 
routinely   
● All clients with gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting, liver tenderness, 
hepatomegaly or jaundice) should have their liver function assessed  
● Patients should be screened for other causes of liver injury  (the hepatitis viruses -A, B, C)  
● Table 8.4 shows the grading of liver injury and management of DILI  
● Once the drugs are discontinued, no attempt should be made to reintroduce these drugs● Once the drugs are discontinued, no attempt should be made to reintroduce these drugs

sessions  
● Obtain consent from the patient to contact the treatment supporter if needed  
Support group  ● Link the patient to psychosocial support groups and other community -based 
support mechanisms (preferably through direct introduction)  
o Support groups give confidence and encouragement and promote positive 
attitude towards HIV status and may promote disclosure  
o Support groups offer opportunities for additional counselling and 
experience sharing and are an avenue for developing/strengthening life 
skills  
o Some support groups engage in economic empowerment activities  
o Support groups can be used for ART distribution to improve  convenience

1 - 2  ▪ Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 
months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/breastfeeding), and 
then every 6 months until c omplete cessation of breastfeeding  
▪ Before any drug substitution (if no VL result available from the prior 6 months)  
▪ Three months after any regimen modification (including single -drug substitution)  
● PLHIV should receive differentiated care based on initial e valuation (advanced vs. well) 
and follow up (established vs not established on ART)  
 
1.3 Standard Package of Care for PLHIV  
Consists of 8 components:  
1. Antiretroviral Therapy  
▪ All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO▪ All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO 
clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities  
▪ ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, preferably within 
two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis (except for patients with cryptococcal 
meningitis or TB meningi tis) 
2. Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention, GBV/IPV & HIV Education and Counselling  
▪ All patients should be counselled and supported for disclosure of HIV status; 
partner/ family testing and engagement; condom use; family planning; sexually 
transmitted infections screening; treatment adherence; and pre -exposure 
prophylaxis for HIV -negative sexual partners  
▪ All females aged 15 -49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services▪ All females aged 15 -49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services 
should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as p art of the standard 
package of care  
▪ All PLHIV should be provided with HIV education and counselling  
3. Screening for and Prevention of Specific Opportunistic Infections  
Cotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) is no longer recommended as life -long 
prophylaxis, and is only recommended in the following sub populations, unless they 
have an allergy to sulfur drugs or develop toxicity from CPT  
● All HIV Exposed Infants  
● HIV infected children < 15 years of age  
● All PLHIV > 15 years of age:  
o Living in malaria -endemic zones  (Refer to the National Guidelines for theo Living in malaria -endemic zones  (Refer to the National Guidelines for the 
Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Malaria in Kenya for the current Kenya 
Malaria endemicity map)  
o Presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 event, or meeting the AHD criteria  
o Suspected treatment fa ilure  
● All Pregnant and Breast -feeding womenSummary of Key Recommendations  
1 - 7  1.8 HBV/HIV and HCV/HIV Co -infection Preve ntion and Management  
• All HIV positive adolescents and adults should be screened for HBV infection, using serum 
HBsAg, as part of initial evaluation; children who did not complete routine childhood 
immunizations should also be screened for HBV and vaccinat ed if negative.  
• PLHIV without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated 
against hepatitis B  
• The recommended first -line ART for adults with HIV/HBV co -infection is TDF+ 3TC + DTG  
• HCV serology should be offered to individuals at  risk of HCV infection  
• Direct acting antiviral therapies (DAAs) for treatment of HCV have simplified the 
management of HIV/HCV co -infectionmanagement of HIV/HCV co -infection  
 
1.9 ARVs for Post -exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)  
• PEP should be offered as soon as possible (< 72 hours) after high -risk exposure  
• The recommended ARV agents for PEP are  
▪  <15 years old  
▪ < 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG  
▪ ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG  
▪ ≥ 15 years old  
▪ TDF + 3TC + DTG  
 
1.10 Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)  
• PrEP should be offered to HIV negative individuals at substantial ongoing risk of HIV 
infection (including the seronegative partner in a discordant relationship)  
•  PrEP works if taken as prescribed . However, it does not prevent other STIs or unintended 
pregnancies, therefore, additional protection should be of fered.  
• PrEP should only be offered to clients  ≥15 years of age who are sexually active after• PrEP should only be offered to clients  ≥15 years of age who are sexually active after 
eligibility assessment using  the following parameters:  
▪ Laboratory: HIV negative  
▪ Medical (for oral PrEP): no contraindication to TDF; no severe renal diseases; wei ght 
≥ 30 kg  
▪ Client readiness: client must be willing to take PrEP as prescribed, and adhere to 
associated follow up and HIV testing (at enrollment, at month 1 and thereafter every 
3 months)  
• The recommended ARV regimen for Oral PrEP is TDF/FTC (alternative  TDF/3TC), 
available in two dosing strategies:  
▪ Daily oral PrEP: TDF (300 mg) + FTC (200 mg) once daily  
▪ Event -driven PrEP : Event driven PrEP is where oral PrEP is used in men having sex▪ Event -driven PrEP : Event driven PrEP is where oral PrEP is used in men having sex 
with men when an isolated sexual act is anticipated. The dose is two pills of TDF/FTC 
taken between 2 and 24 hours (preferably closer to 24h) before the anticipated 
sexual act; then, a third pill taken 24 hours after the first two pills; and then a fourth 
pill taken 24 hours after the third pill (“2+1+1”).Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022  
2 - 10  Presumptive Diagnosis of Severe HIV Disease in Children under 18 Months  
Occasionally, children less than 18 months of age present to hospital with severe illness; and a rapid 
HIV antibody test confirm s HIV exposure. Lack of immediate availability of HIV DNA PCR results 
for confirmation of HIV could result in undue delay in starting life -saving ART. In such children, a 
presumptive diagnosis of HIV infection can be made using the criteria in Table 2.3. A RT can be 
initiated while awaiting HIV DNA PCR results to confirm HIV infection.

2.4.1.2  Birth Testing  
Birth testing is defined as HIV testing (with DNA PCR) at birth or around birth for infants born to 
HIV-positive mothers. Birth testing has the potential to improve survival for infants who are 
infected during pregnancy, around labour and delivery by ident ifying them early for rapid ART 
initiation. Do not use cord blood for birth testing as this could result in false positive results.A DNA PCR test can be offered at birth or around birth where feasible.  
ALL children initially tested at birth should be rete sted at 6 weeks of age and the EID 
algorithm followed (Figure 2.2.)  
Considerations for providing birth testing:  
Birth testing may be prioritized for newborns who are at high risk of HIV acquisition including 
those born to:  
● Mothers who seroconvert during p regnancy.  
● Mothers who have unsuppressed or unknown viral loads during delivery.  
● Mothers who received a HIV positive diagnosis for the first time at or after 28 weeks 
gestation or during labour and delivery  
● Mother on ART for less than 12 weeks prior to delivery  
Birth testing should be offered where this is feasible:Birth testing should be offered where this is feasible:  
● DNA PCR results can be returned the same  day e.g., where on site point of care is available.  
● ART regimens recommended for neonates as per national guidelines are available and can 
be initiated immed iately.  
● Follow -up of the newborn is done to ensure no lost to follow -up.63 - 264Annexes

12. People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) and HIV  
 
12.1 Introduction  
The use of ART for HIV treatment in key populations should follow the same general principles 
and recommendations as for all adults. Individuals within key populations groups may experience 
discrimination and marginali zation that can impede their access to health care, including 
treatment for HIV, and frequently present late for treatment. It is important to ensure that people 
from key populations have equitable access to HIV treatment and care.  Programs should ensure 
that missed opportunities are minimized and every single encounter with key populations is 
optimally used. ART service delivery includes decentralization of HIV care and treatment andoptimally used. ART service delivery includes decentralization of HIV care and treatment and 
integration of ART services into other clinical services such as Medical ly Assisted Therapy and 
drop -in centers where appropriate capacity exists.  
People who inject drugs (PWID) are at increased risk of HIV infection. In Kenya, the HIV 
prevalence among PWID is up to 4 times that of the general population. PWID also suffer a hi gher 
burden of viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV), TB and sexually transmitted infections irrespective of 
their HIV status. Despite this, PWID have limited access to HIV treatment and prevention services.  
Every effort should be made to implement evidence -inform ed interventions in the comprehensiveEvery effort should be made to implement evidence -inform ed interventions in the comprehensive 
package of measures targeting PWID, either in combination or (depending on site capacity) singly, 
with linkage to comprehensive care (Table 12.1).  
Package of care for PWID  
PWID have complex needs related to drug dependency, psychosocial and medical 
complications of injection and other substance use. When they require ART, anti -TB, or any 
other therapy, they are at increased risk of adverse drug reactions, drug -drug interactions and 
non-adherence.  These patients a re best comprehensively managed by providers who have 
received specific training in the management of injection drug users. Once identified, PWIDreceived specific training in the management of injection drug users. Once identified, PWID 
should be counselled and linked to programs with the capacity to offer comprehensive care for 
such patients.Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults

6.5.2 Changing ARVs Due to Adverse Drug Reactions  
Patients starting ART should be educated on the potential side effects of ART and all ot her 
prescribed medication.  ADRs can have a significant impact on patient adherence and must be 
identified early and managed aggressively. All ADRs should be reported to the Pharmacy and 
Poisons Board using existing pharmacovigilance tools 
(http://www.pv.pharmacyboardkenya.org/ ). Pharmacovigilance is particularly important for 
monitoring ADRs associated with any new ARVs that enter the national supply chain, as rare 
ADRs may appear in routine care, whi ch were not observed in the highly selected patients 
participating in clinical trials.participating in clinical trials.  
The most common significant ADRs associated with ARVs that may require a drug substitution 
are summarized in Table 6.5. General principles for managing ADRs are outlined  in Figure 6.3. 
Managing specific ADRs is described in Tables 6.6 to 6.9.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

o Reduced risk of respiratory infections and chronic lung disease  
o Reduced risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, and stroke  
o Improved infant outcomes (for pregnant women)  
o Reduced risk of cancers: lung, bladder, breast, mouth, throat, esophagus  
o Better response to ART (better viral suppression)  
o Reduced risk of developing TB or dying from TBo Reduced risk of developing TB or dying from TB  
● Tobacco dependence treatment and cessation programs should combine behavioral/counseling 
support with pharmacotherapy treatment where necessary and available. For further details on 
cessation interventions, refer to the Kenya National Guidelines for Tobacco Dependence 
Treatment  
Refer to Table 4.1 8 for tips to assist a client to quit smoking

8 - 11 8.2.4. Follow -up of Patients on TPT  
Patients on TPT should be followed up on a monthly basis and their return -to-clinic dates 
harmonized with any other routine schedules. During each clinic visit, conduct the following;  
● Symptom screening for active TB disease and update status  
● Assess and reinforce adherence to treatment  
● If a patient screens positive for TB while on TPT, stop TPT and manage according to 
National TB guidelines  
● Assess for any adverse drug reactions at each visit and intervene appropriately  
● Provide/update TPT appointment card  
● Document and update the relevant recording and reporting tools, e.g., ICF/TPT cards, 
Contact Management/TPT registerContact Management/TPT register  
● Document outcome of TPT use e.g., completion in the relevant tools and/or EMR  
*Baseline liver function tests are not mandatory for patients initiating TPT. These may, however, be 
considered on an individual ba sis, especially for patients taking other medications for chronic 
medical conditions or symptomatic patients suspected to have active hepatitis  
 
8.3. Identifying and Managing Drug Toxicities from TPT  
The management of drug toxicities should be based on severity, with appropriate grading of 
individual patients. The most common adverse drug reactions associated with TPT are peripheral 
neuropathy, drug -induced liver injury (DILI), and rash.  
8.3.1 Periphe ral Neuropathy - Suspected drug: INH        
Diagnosis of Peripheral Neuropathy8.3.1 Periphe ral Neuropathy - Suspected drug: INH        
Diagnosis of Peripheral Neuropathy  
● Symptoms include: burning sensation, numbness, or tingling, usually starting at the feet 
on both sides  
● May have decreased sensation on examination  
● May develop weakness in severe cases  
● May be potentiated by other neurotoxic drugs, alcoholism, metabolic disease (e.g., 
diabetes), malnutrition and infections  
● Rarely severe enough to require drug withdrawal  
Management of INH -induced Peripheral Neuropathy  
● Increase the dose of pyridoxine to 100 mg per day  
● For children give double the standard weight -based dose  
● Assess for other causes of peripheral neuropathy (e.g., diabetes, thyroid disorder, B12 
deficiency, syphilis, etc.)deficiency, syphilis, etc.)  
● Relief of symptoms can be achieved with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants 
(amitriptyline, nortriptyline), anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin)  
● If symptoms do not improve, or there is any worsening, then discontinue TPT; symptoms 
may persist even  after discontinuing TPTAdherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support  
5 - 11 Table 5.3: Adherence Support and Retention Intervention s 
Standard Adherence Support Interventions  
Structural 
interventions  ● Conduct a baseline psychosocial assessment to explore the various aspects of 
the client’s life that may influence their adherence to treatment and 
prevention, and their general well -being. This teases out issues that need to 
be explored in detail during the counselling session e.g., disclosure, family 
planning, living circumstances etc.  
● Use a multidisciplinary team approach to develop and implement treatment 
plans for each patien t 
● Engage peer educators to lead HIV education and support services  
● Adequately prepare and assess the patient’s readiness to initiate and continue 
with ART● Adequately prepare and assess the patient’s readiness to initiate and continue 
with ART  
● Implement a system for identifying and taking action when patients miss an 
appointment  
● Formalize a sy stem for providing health talks and treatment literacy classes 
for patients  
● Formalize a system for linking patients to community -based resources, 
including: community support groups, religious groups, CBOs, groups 
supporting income -generating activities, o rganizations providing food 
support, NEPHAK, child welfare societies, community health volunteers/units, 
schools, children’s homes etc.  
 
HIV 
education 
and 
counselling  ● Remind the patient about HIV disease, how ART works, the importance of 
high -level adherence and the consequences of non -adherencehigh -level adherence and the consequences of non -adherence  
o Risk of ill health caused by HIV  
o Role of ART in restoring and maintaining good health  
o Link between adherence and viral load, CD4 and health  
o Side effects of medications and how to avoid, recognize and manage them. 
Manage side effects aggressively  
o Address misconceptions and beliefs about HIV and ART  
● Discuss and agree on a treatment plan with the patient. Gain commitment 
from the patient to follow through  
● Discuss use of alcohol and drugs and  how to prevent these from affecting the 
treatment plan  
● It is important to maintain a non -judgmental attitude, establish trust with 
parents/caregivers, and involve the child as they matureSummary of Key Recommendations  
1 - 5  • Persistent low -level viremia ( pLLV) is defined as having VL 200 - 999 copies/ml on two 
or more consecutive measures. These patients are at increased risk of progression to 
treatment failure, dev elopment of ARV resistance and death and therefore require a 
similar case management approach as patients with an initial VL ≥ 1,000 copies/ml  
• All PLHIV with a detectable VL ≥ 200 copies/ ml (unsuppressed) : assess for and address 
potential reasons for virem ia, including intensifying adherence support, and repeat the 
VL after 3 months of excellent adherence  
▪ If the repeat VL is < 200  copies/ml ( suppres sed) then continue routine 
monitoring  
▪ If the repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml (suspected treatment failure), prepare formonitoring  
▪ If the repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml (suspected treatment failure), prepare for 
change to an effective regimen (Figure 5.2 and Table 6.10)  
▪ If the repeat VL is 200 - 999 copies/ml (low level viremia),  reassess adherence 
and other causes of viremia and repeat VL after another 3 months of excellent 
adherence  
1.6 Pre vention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV/Syphilis/HBV  
• Prevention of mother -to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV,  Syphilis and Hepatitis B  
(triple elimination ) should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully 
integrated, routine antenatal  care interventions  
• All pregnant women, unless known positive, should be counseled and tested for HIV,• All pregnant women, unless known positive, should be counseled and tested for HIV, 
Syphilis (using the HIV -Syphilis dual test) and HBV during their first ANC visit, and if 
negative a repeat HIV -Syphilis dual test should be performed in the 3rd trimester.  
• Lifelong ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living 
with HIV, regardless of gestational age, WHO clinical stage or CD4 count  
• ART should be started as soon as possible, ideally on the same day HIV diagnosis is  made, 
with ongoing enhanced adherence support  
• The preferred first line ART regimen for pregnant and breastfeeding women is TDF + 3TC 
+ DTG  
• For pregnant and breastfeeding women newly initiated on ART, obtain VL 3 months after+ DTG  
• For pregnant and breastfeeding women newly initiated on ART, obtain VL 3 months after 
initiation, and then every 6 m onths until complete cessation of breastfeeding  
• For HIV positive women already on ART at the time of confirming pregnancy or 
breastfeeding, obtain a VL irrespective of when prior VL was done, and then every 6 
months until complete cessation of breastfeeding  
• For pregnant or breastfeeding women with a VL ≥ 200 copies/m l (unsuppressed ): assess 
for and address potential reasons for viremia, including intensifying adherence support, 
and repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence  
▪ If the repea t VL is < 200  copies/ml (suppressed) then continue routine 
monitoring▪ If the repea t VL is < 200  copies/ml (suppressed) then continue routine 
monitoring  
▪ If the repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml (treatment failure), prepare for change to 
an effective regimen  
▪ If the repeat VL is 200  - 999 copies/ml ( low level viremia ), reassess adherence 
and other causes of viremia and consult the Regional or National TWGKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

or comorbidities/co -infections. O nce a diagnosis of HIV infection is confirmed, ART should beor comorbidities/co -infections. O nce a diagnosis of HIV infection is confirmed, ART should be 
initiated as soon as possible (preferably within 2 weeks), once patient readiness has been 
determined. Other sections of these guidelines deal with initial evaluation and monitoring 
(Chapter 3), patient preparation and adherence support (Chapter 5), and specific recommended 
ART regimens (Chapter 6).Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Maternal healthcare begins with preconception counselling (Table 4. 9), and continues 
throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding. The standard package of antenatal and postnatal 
services in the context of HIV is described in Chapter 7 of these guidelines.  
4.5 Non -communicable Diseases Screening and Management  
4.5.1 Metabolic Disorders  
Screening, prevention and management of specific NCDs are included in the standard package of 
care for PLHIV because of their associated high morbidity and mortality. PLHIV are at higher risk 
for cardiovascular, liver and kidney disease because o f the chronic inflammatory state associatedfor cardiovascular, liver and kidney disease because o f the chronic inflammatory state associated 
with HIV infection itself, and also as a side -effect of some of the ARVs.  
The modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease include tobacco use and exposure to 
tobacco smoke, unhealthy diets, overweight/obe sity, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol, 
hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, infections such as rheumatic fever and HIV. Advancing 
age, sex, race/ethnicity and family history are non -modifiable risk factors associated with 
cardiovascular dise ases  
HIV and other chronic diseases require health systems that support chronic care and  
adherence; their management should be integrated at the health facility, including at the 
primary care level.primary care level.  
Lifestyle modifications are always the first line of prev ention and management for 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidaemia (Table 4. 10). These are 
recommended for all patients to prevent these NCDs and should be integrated into routine HIV 
treatment and prevention. Recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and initial management 
of hypertension, type 2 DM, dyslipidaemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are provided in

Adherence Support  
Psychosocial support for PLHIV and their families is essential for their well -being and good health 
outcomes. HIV affects virtually every aspect of one’s life, as well as the lives of those close to them. 
PLHIV need psychological and social support to deal with various issues that are common toPLHIV need psychological and social support to deal with various issues that are common to 
chronic illness as well as those that are unique to HIV. These include sti gma, bereavement, self -
image, loss of earning capacity, life skills, and chronic illness, among others. Providing 
psychosocial support entails identifying any needs that they may have and addressing them. In 
some cases, some of these needs can be anticipat ed and addressed even before they come to play 
in the individual’s life.  
The individualized patient management plan should include establishing appropriate adherence 
support interventions (Table 5.3).Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022  
3 - 4  Table 3.1 Cont.  
Summary  List differential diagnosis and management plan for each problem (including

well, to guide acuity of follow -up 
3.3 Initial Laboratory Evaluation of PLHIV  
The comprehensiveness of laboratory tests will depend on presence and/or type of suspected 
concurrent illness. Table 3.2 summarizes the recommended baseline laboratory investigations forconcurrent illness. Table 3.2 summarizes the recommended baseline laboratory investigations for 
all PLHIV. Additional investigations should be based on clinical indicati on. ART should not be 
delayed if a laboratory test is not available.

laboratories should automatically perform a serum 
cryptococcal antigen (sCrAg) on the same sample to screen 
for cryptococcal infectioncryptococcal antigen (sCrAg) on the same sample to screen 
for cryptococcal infection  
● TB-LAM should also be conducted   
Viral load (HIV -1 RNA)  ● Baseline viral load (VL) is recommended for infants after 
1st PCR test is positive. Specimen for baseline VL can be 
drawn at the time of initiating ART; obtaining a VL should 
not delay ART initiation

Approaches to improve adherence include:  
● Encourage ring users to keep ring in place continuously through the 28 -day period from 
initial insertion  
● Disclosure of PrEP use to a partner or trusted person  
● Use of reminder de vices like a cell phone alarm.  
● SMS reminders where available and feasible  
● Exploring and mitigation of other barriers to adherence  
● Peer support  
11.9 Monitoring Sero -conversion among PrEP users  
PrEP substantially reduce the risk of HIV acquisition.  The effi cacy of PrEP is correlated with 
adherence.  Sero -conversion during use of PrEP should be monitored critically as it is increasingadherence.  Sero -conversion during use of PrEP should be monitored critically as it is increasing 
the risk of developing drug resistance if clients continue the use of PrEP while HIV infected.  
Factors that lead to HIV seroco nversion among PrEP sero -converters include:  
● Inconsistency in use of PrEP (non -adherence).  
● Social -behavioral factors e.g., poverty, HIV stigma and relationship status that may affect 
the ability to use PrEP as prescribed.  
● Possible infections with drug res istant strains  
 
What should be done upon identification of a PrEP sero -converter?  
HIV testing among PrEP should be conducted consistently as per the algorithm. Identification of 
new HIV positive diagnosis among PrEP users should be followed with:  
● Immediate discontinuation of PrEP● Immediate discontinuation of PrEP  
● Counselling of client on positive results  
● Linkage to care and ART (immediate ART initiation).  
● Assessment of barriers to adherence that may affect use of ART.  
● Document sero -conversion in client file, PrEP registers, and monthly reporting as 
required.Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults  
6 - 7 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART  
The objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter -
current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to 
treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, 
additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a 
laboratory test result may alter patient management.  
Indications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral 
load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug -drug interactions, co -morbidities and 
treatment failure.treatment failure.  
6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line 
ART  
Patients who are virally suppressed o n first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even 
if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug -drug interactions requiring a 
change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and 
adolescen ts <15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long -term toxicity and improve cost -
effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to 
efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for  children, adolescents and 
adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG -containing regimen, proactiveadults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG -containing regimen, proactive 
switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible 
dolutegravir tablet.  
Children and adolesc ents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the 
recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as 
per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band.  This also 
includes PL HIV who recently initiated non -standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the 
first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the 
patient/caregiver.  
Always discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV,  particularlyAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV,  particularly 
side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the 
new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1 -2 weeks.Standard Package of Care for PLHIV

8 - 9 8.2. TB Preventive Therapy (TPT)  
This section summarizes the current national recommendations for treatment of latent TB 
infections (LTBI) in the PLHIV population. These are in line with the updated World Health 
Organization guidelines which include the use of shorter, safer LTBI treatment options for an 
expanded at -risk population. For further guidance, refer to the national guidelines on LTBI 
management.  
8.2.1. Indications for TPT  
TPT should be provided to those p atients in whom TB is excluded (using the ICF tool) and meet 
the eligibility criteria to initiate TPT. The following client categories are eligible for TPT who 
screen negative for active TBscreen negative for active TB  
● All PLHIV above 12 months of age (children, adolescents and adults  including pregnant 
and breastfeeding women)  
● All household contacts of persons with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB            
● Prisoners and staff working in prison setting            
● Health care workers and other staff in health care setting  
● Other clinical risk groups as defined in LTBI guidelines  
*Neonates born to mothers with TB, or exposed to close contacts with TB should be given TPT 
once TB disease has been ruled out. BCG should be given 2 weeks after completion of TPT or anti -
TB treatment  
Summary of recommendations for TPT among the PLHIV  
● PLHIV are at a much higher risk of getting TB disease compared to the general population● PLHIV are at a much higher risk of getting TB disease compared to the general population  
● TB preventive therapy should be given to all PLHIV above 12 months of age who do not 
have active TB disease. This should be done irrespective of immune status, ART status, 
previous history of TB and pregnancy status.  
● Children aged <12 months living with HIV who are household contacts of a person with 
bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB, and whom act ive TB has been ruled out 
should receive TB preventive therapy.  
● TPT may be given immediately following successful completion of TB treatment among 
the PLHIV.  
● Repeat TPT is not recommended among PLHIV except if a PLHIV becomes a 
household contact of a perso n with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TBhousehold contact of a perso n with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB  
● PLHIV aged 15 years and above should be provided with 3 months of weekly Rifapentine 
and Isoniazid (3HP), while those less than 15 years are given 6 months of daily INH (6H)  
● In PLHIV on PI/r -based ART, pregna nt women and those who do not tolerate 3HP should 
be given six months of daily INH (6H)  
● For eligible patients previously treated for TB, initiate TPT upon completion of their TB 
treatment.Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support  
5 - 9 Table 5.1 Cont.  
Ongoing Support at Subsequent Visits  
● Review the patient’s HIV knowledge  
● Review the patient’s motivation to take ART  
● Elicit any concerns the patient may have about their ART, side effects, visit schedule, or health  
● Review the ART dosing schedule and ask about any missed pills  
● Explore barriers to adherence that were previously identified or new ones that have developed  
● Explore any recent or expected changes in their life or daily routine  
● Discuss their individualized adherence plan and if any changes are required  
 
HIV Education and Counselling  
HIV education should be a standard component of the enrolment visit. Prior to ART initiation, allHIV education should be a standard component of the enrolment visit. Prior to ART initiation, all 
patients/caregivers must be provided with enough information to make an informed choice about 
ART initiation and adherence (Table 5.2), including for patients who initiate ART during the 
enrolment visit. A detailed content guide for HIV education and adherence counselling is provided 
in Annex 8. This information can be provided through group or individual counselling. The ART 
Readiness Assessment an d the management plan should be completed for each patient 
individually (Table 5.4).Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

2.4.3  HIV testing for Pregnant Women  
For pregnant women, the HIV/syphilis dual test should be used as the A1 test (Figure 2.4). The dual 
test kit is recommended for:  
● Pregnant women during their first ANC, unless the woman is known to be living with HIV.● Pregnant women during their first ANC, unless the woman is known to be living with HIV.  
● For those who test negative for both HIV and Syphilis repeat testing should be conducted 
in the third trimester using the HIV and syphilis dual test.  
● Partners accompanying pregnant women for the first -time during ANC  
HIV/Syphilis dual test should not be used for retesting women on ART or with  known positive HIV 
status, or women diagnosed with syphilis during pregnancy.

 11 - 12 Table 11.7 Cont: Summary of PrEP Initial and Follow -up Assessment  
During every visit  
• Assess adherence  
• Reassess risk of HIV infection and offer risk reduction counselling  
• HIV testing should be repeated at month 1 and thereafter, every 3 months (this applies for both 
daily and Event driven PrEP)  
• Assess for adverse effects   
11.5 Contra -indications to Oral PrEP (daily or ED PrEP)  
• HIV infection or suspected acute HIV infection (i.e., flu -like symptoms in the last 4 weeks in 
combination with a preceding h igh-risk exposure for HIV)  
• Adolescents < 35 kg or age < 15 years  
• Impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance of <50 ml/min)• Impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance of <50 ml/min)  
• Unable or unwilling to adhere to prescribed PrEP or follow -up schedule.  
11.6 Criteria for Discontinuing Oral PrEP  
PrEP should be discontinued if ANY of the following criteria are met.  
● Positive HIV test during follow up.  
● Change in risk status (no ongoing risk)  
● Renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min  
● Client request to stop.  
● Sustained non -adherence.  
Discontinuing daily oral PrEP:   Users discontinuing PrEP due to no ongoing risk or requesting 
to stop should continue PrEP for at least 7 days after the last potential exposure to HIV. Reasons 
for discontinuation should be documented in the client’s record.for discontinuation should be documented in the client’s record.  
Discontinuing event –driven PrEP:  Event -driven PrEP can be stopped after two daily doses 
following the last sexual exposure.  
11.7 Restarting PrEP  
Any client restarting PrEP regardless of the preferred method should be assessed for HIV status 
and a rapid HI V test conducted:  
● Daily Oral PrEP : Clients who stop PrEP for more than 7 days and wishes to restart should 
be assessed for resumption of PrEP similar to the assessment done for an initial (first) visit. 
Importantly, conduct a HIV test before re -starting PrEP. If a high -risk exposure occurre d in 
the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIVthe previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV 
test after 4 weeks; if negative, PrEP can be prescribed if the other criteria are fulfilled. The 
use of condoms should be recommended during the waiting per iod.  
● Event driven Oral PrEP :  Clients who have stopped PrEP for more than a week and who are 
restarting ED -PrEP should commence with a double dose (two pills) of PrEP as new 
initiators. Risk assessment should be conducted. If a high -risk exposure occurred  in the 
previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV 
test after 4 weeks; if negative, PrEP can be prescribed if the other criteria are fulfilled. The 
use of condoms should be recommended during the waiting peri od.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022  
6 - 6 Table 6.4 Cont.  
Pregnancy Safety of DTG  
● DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all 
women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be 
offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.  
Important Drug Interactions with DTG  
● Rifampicin  
o Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who 
are > 20 kg in body weight. Children <20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase 
their weight -appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.  
o There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti -TB 
medications (including for MDR -TB)medications (including for MDR -TB) 
● Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron 
supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)  
o These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 
hours after taking any of these supplements  
o Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if 
DTG is taken with a meal  
o It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interact ion because many patients get 
these supplements and antacids over -the-counter without informing their healthcare provider  
● Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin● Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin  
o These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available  
o If DTG must be co -administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although 
there is little data to guide this  
o If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment  
● Metformin  
o DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of 
metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of 
metformin 1 g  
● Other drug -drug interactions with DTG

TB-LAM is a rapid point -of-care urine dip -stick test that can be performed at the bedside. LAM stands for 
lipoarabinomannan, which  can be detected in urine when it sheds off of the TB  cell wall . 
GeneXpert is the recommended initial diagnostic test for people with presumptive TB.
TB-LAM SHOULD NOT be used as an alternative test to GeneXpert, but can be performed  to help diagnose TB while 
waiting for GeneXpert test results. TB -LAM cannot detect resistance to rifampicin.
Indications for use of TB -LAM, as an adjunct test to GeneXpert:
• PLHIV with advanced disease (WHO stage 3 or 4 or CD4 count       cells/mm3 (or       for children     
years old)) with presumed TByears old)) with presumed TB 
• PLHIV that have any danger signs of severe illness: respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute, temperature >39°C, 
heart rate >120 beats per minute, unable to walk unaided
• Currently admitted to hospital 
LF-LAM Negative LF-LAM Positive
TB is not ruled out 
• Evaluate the clinical response after 3–5 days of 
antibiotic treatment, while awaiting GeneXpert 
resultsTB is likely
• Initiate TB treatment
• Conduct additional investigations for TB 
and other HIV related diseases as 
appropriate
• Continue TB treatment even if GeneXpert 
results come back negative
Clinical improvementClinical worsening or no 
improvement
TB is unlikely
• Conduct additional investigations for TB and 
other opportunistic illnesses
• Complete the course of parenteral antibiotics
Note:other opportunistic illnesses
• Complete the course of parenteral antibiotics
Note: 
• If GeneXpert results are positive for TB, 
initiate TB treatment irrespective of TB -LAM 
results or clinical improvement 
• If GeneXpert results are negative for TB, 
consider TPTTB is likely
• Start TB treatment if patient is seriously 
ill or if GeneXpert results come back 
positive (irrespective of TB -LAM results)
• Conduct additional investigations for TB 
and other HIV -related diseases
• Complete the course of parenteral 
antibiotics

3. Initial Evaluation and Follow up  
 
3.1 Introduction  
All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical  stage, age, 
pregnancy status, or comorbidities. ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, 
preferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis.  
In order to provide targeted services based on clinical presentation, during the init ial evaluation 
all PLHIV should be categorized as presenting with advanced HIV disease (AHD) or as presenting 
well (Table 3.3). Patients with advanced disease require more intensive evaluation for and 
management of OIs, and once ART is started, they are at  higher risk of developing immunemanagement of OIs, and once ART is started, they are at  higher risk of developing immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS, Annex 16).  
Similarly, after at least 6 months on ART, PLHIV should be categorized as being either established 
or not established on ART (clinically, virologically, and psychosoci ally) to best meet the specific 
needs of each patient for treatment and follow -up and improve patient outcomes through provision 
of targeted differentiated care. Differentiated care minimizes inconvenience and unnecessary 
frequent follow -up, thus reducing costs and time related to clinic visits. It also allows resources to 
be focused on those patients who require additional attention.  
3.2 Initial Clinical Evaluation of PLHIV3.2 Initial Clinical Evaluation of PLHIV  
All patients enrolling into HIV care should have a complete medical history taken, a thorough 
physical examination and appropriate laboratory investigations. Findings from this initial 
evaluation should be documented legibly in a retrievable health record management format 
(electronic or paper -based) to facilitate long -term follow -up of the patient. Table 3.1 summarizes 
important aspects of the initial medical history and physical examination for PLHIV.  
The initial visit provides the opportunity to establish a meaningful patient -provider relationship; 
the clinician should elicit concerns  and expectations with open, non -judgmental, and clear 
communication.Annexes

Recommended Dosing of DTG  
● < 20 kg body weight: Use weight -based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10  
● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film -coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also 
available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10  
● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of 
rifampicin -containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, 
then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher -dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver 
enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is 
completed)  
● For patients w ith suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a 
RAL -based regimen): use DTG twice daily  
● DTG can be taken with or without food  
Common Side Effects of DTG● DTG can be taken with or without food  
Common Side Effects of DTG  
● The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually 
resolve after continued use for 1 -2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these 
potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and 
consult a HCW if concerned.  
● Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a 
morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low -fat meal or on an empty stomach.  
● DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels bu t this does NOT represent a true decline in 
renal function.renal function.  
● Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about 
healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.  
● All ad verse events should be reported through the national pharmacovigilance mechanism.

4.4.1 Sexually Transmitted Infections  
Screening for syphilis using VDRL, TPHA, or RPR should be performed as a baseline investigation 
for all adolescent and adult PLHIV. Pregnant women should be screened for Syphilis during the 
first ANC visit and 3rd trimester.  
 
All PLHIV should be assessed for symptoms of STIs using the National Algorithm s for Treating 
Common STI Syndromes (Kenya National guidelines for management and control of STIs, 2018. 
Annex 4). Sexual partners should be treated as well.  
 
Risk reduction counselling and provision of condoms is an integral part of STI treatment.  
 
Patien ts who have persistent signs and symptoms of STIs after syndromic treatment shouldPatien ts who have persistent signs and symptoms of STIs after syndromic treatment should 
undergo diagnostic evaluation for definitive diagnosis and treatment.  
 
At initial diagnosis of HIV, all sex workers should be treated for presumptive gonorrhoea and 
chlamydi a (following treatment recommendations of vaginal/urethral discharge syndrome as 
per national STI guidelines), with presumptive treatment every quarter.  
 
4.4.2 Family Planning and Pre -Conception Counselling  
Pregnancy status should be determined for all wom en of reproductive age at every visit (based 
on history of last menstrual period and, if uncertain, irregular, or delayed, then a urine pregnancy 
test should be performed).test should be performed).  
 
Pregnancy intention should be determined for all women of reproductive age and the ir partners 
so that appropriate family planning or pre -conception counselling can be provided.  
 
For patients who do not have an immediate desire to become pregnant, dual contraception 
(defined as condoms plus another form of effective contraception) should  be provided 
immediately with follow -up appointments scheduled to ensure no interruption in contraception 
provision. Table 4.8  outlines contraception options for PLHIV based on the ARVs they are using.TB/HIV Co -infection, Prevention and Management

everyone with HIV  
● Starting treatment as soon as possible (preferably within two weeks of testing positive 
for HIV) reduces the chance of your illness getting worse or of passing HIV to othersfor HIV) reduces the chance of your illness getting worse or of passing HIV to others  
● If you take your ART properly and do not miss pills you can expect to live a long and 
productive life  
 
5.2.2 ART Treatment Preparatio n 
ART treatment preparation involves HIV education and counselling, including identifying likely 
barriers to adherence, a discussion of strategies and support systems to overcome possible 
barriers to adherence, and an individualized adherence plan, as summ arized in Table 5.1. The 
education and counseling sessions should be documented in patient charts.

o HIV viral load and its relationship to health and to HIV transmission  
o Goals of ART  
o Relationship between adherence and viral suppression, treatment failure, and drug 
resistance  
o Consequences of drug resistance  
• Ensure the patient understands by asking them to explain it back to you

2 - 19  The window period is the time from exposure to HIV infection to when the body produces enough 
HIV antibodies to be detected by an HIV antibody test. This time can vary across different types of 
tests, where some tests may be able to detect antibodies earli er than another test, which can lead 
to discrepant test results.  
All people with an inconclusive HIV status should be encouraged to return in 14 days for retesting. 
Receiving inconclusive results could be confusing and stressful for clients and may be dif ficult for 
the provider to explain. During post -test counselling, the provider needs to take time to explainthe provider to explain. During post -test counselling, the provider needs to take time to explain 
carefully what an HIV -inconclusive status means, stating that it is neither HIV -positive nor HIV -
negative, and that retesting in 14 days is needed to establish the correct diagnosis. Because 
definitive diagnosis cannot be made on the day of testing, and immediate referral to HIV care or 
ART initiation is not appropriate, providers need to help clients make a clear plan for follow -up and 
schedule an a ppointment for retesting. Also, clients should be informed about prevention options 
and how to stay HIV -negative, as well as about the availability and benefits of ART.  
Those suspected of having an acute HIV infection1 – for example, if they report or pre sent withThose suspected of having an acute HIV infection1 – for example, if they report or pre sent with 
symptoms associated with acute HIV infection – should be followed up closely. This is a period of 
high infectiousness due to high viral load, and clients need to be informed how to protect their 
partners. Individuals at high ongoing risk of HIV c an be informed about PrEP and encouraged to 
discuss options depending on their final HIV status when they come back for retesting.

Screening  Action  
HIV -positive at 
initial evaluation  Do not start PrEP, counsel and link to care and treatment  
HIV -positive after 
initiation of PrEP  Discontinue PrEP, counsel and link to care and treatment. Take DBS or plasma 
sample for drug resistance testing.  
 
Positive STI Screen  Thorough genitourinary and anorectal examination, urine dipstick for urethritis, 
serological testing for syphilis, full STI evaluation if resources available (refer to 
STI algorithm). Refer to guidelines on syndromic management of STIs.  
HBsAg -negative  Offer HBV vaccinationHBsAg -negative  Offer HBV vaccination  
 
HBsAg -positive  This is not a contraindication to oral PrEP.  However, will require monitoring of 
liver function and referral for management of liver disease.  
NB: TDF -based daily or event -driven oral PrEP can be safely offered to 
persons with HBV infection.  
Hepatitis C - 
Negative  Continue PrEP and follow Hepatitis C testing algorithm.  
Hepatitis C - 
Positive  Continue PrEP, refer for Hepatitis C confirmatory testing and management with 
directly acting antivirals (DAAs).  
Flu-like illness after 
initiating PrEP  Continue PrEP, test for HIV at first contact and after 28 days, and if negative,  
continue with usual follow -upcontinue with usual follow -up 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Side effects of PrEP  GIT - nausea, vomiting, weight loss: these are often mild, self -limiting and occur 
during the first 1 -2 months. Provide supportive counselling, offer symptomatic 
treatment e.g., anti -emetics like metoclopramide 10 mg 8 hourly for 3 to 5 days.  
Renal – individuals may experience transient increase in creatinine, and rarely 
proteinuria and Fanconi’s syndrome (presenting as polyuria, bone pain and 
weakness). Measure creatinine (and ca lculate estimated creatinine clearance) at 
initiation of PrEP and annually thereafter (or whenever indicated (symptom 
directed)).  
If creatinine clearance (eGFR) < 50 ml/min do not start PrEP, recheck after 2 
weeks. Refer for evaluation of underlying renal  disease.weeks. Refer for evaluation of underlying renal  disease.  
If the renal function returns to normal, reassess for PrEP and initiate/ continue 
PrEP.  
PrEP should not be prescribed for individuals using nephrotoxic drugs like 
acyclovir, aminoglycosides, retinoids etc. instead, offer alternative HIV 
prevent ion services.  
 
Pregnancy or 
Breastfeeding  
 Pregnancy and breastfeeding are not contraindications to provision of PrEP.  
Pregnant or breastfeeding women whose sexual partners are HIV positive or are 
at high risk of HIV infection may benefit from PrEP as part of combination 
prevention of HIV infection.  
PrEP is also indicated for HIV -negative women in sero -different partnersh ips 
who wish to conceive. PrEP in these situations can be prescribed during the pre -who wish to conceive. PrEP in these situations can be prescribed during the pre -
conception period and throughout pregnancy to reduce risk of sexual HIV 
infection.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Management of IRIS  
IRIS management is dependent on severity of symptoms and the following general guidance is 
recommended:  
Severity of 
IRIS  Definition  Management  
Mild  • Resolves over time 
in most patients  
• Symptomatic 
treatment is often 
sufficient  
 • Treat the OI and manage the associated 
symptoms  
• Treat IRIS -associated inflammation:  
o NSAIDS for discomfort associated with mild 
inflammation / fevers  
o Inhaled steroids for bronchospasm or 
cough associated with mild pulmonary 
inflammation  
• Surgical intervention:  
o Drainage of abscesses  
o Excision of inflamed and painful lymph 
nodes  
Severe  • Threatens a 
patient’s 
functional state  
• Cause permanent 
disabilitynodes  
Severe  • Threatens a 
patient’s 
functional state  
• Cause permanent 
disability  
• Potentially lead to 
death  
Examples:  
• Decline in 
pulmonary 
capacity from TB 
or MAC infection  
• Neurologic 
complications 
from cryptococcal 
infection  
• Loss of vision from 
CMV retinitis 
infection  • Treat the OI and manage the associated 
symptoms  
• Manage t he IRIS -associated inflammation:  
o If NOT KS: give 1 to 2 mg/kg prednisone for 
1 to 2 weeks. Follow with a period of 
individualized tapering of the dose  
o Do not use corticosteroids for the 
management of KS -related IRIS  
• Closely monitor patients on corticosteroid 
therapy for:  
o Hyperglycemia  
o Hypertension  
o Mental status changes  
o Avascular necrosis  
o Worsening of an existing infectiono Mental status changes

ALGORITHM FOR PULMONARY TB DIAGNOSIS IN CHILDREN  
History of 
presenting 
illness  For all children presenting to a health facility ask for the following suggestive 
symptoms  
● Cough  
● Fever  
● Poor weight gain  
● Lethargy or reduced playfulness  
Suspect TB if the child has two or more of these suggestive symptoms  
Ask for history of contact with adult/adolescent with chronic cough or TB within the 
last 2 years  
Clinical 
evaluation  Examine the child and check for:  
● Temperature > 37.5o (fever)  
● Weight (to confirm poor weight gain, weight loss) – check growth monitoring

5 - 6 5.1.4 How patients can discuss U=U with others  
● Counsel patients to share information about the research on U=U as follows:  
o In recent research studies that involved thousands of couples, no one who was on 
HIV treatment and whose HIV was durably undetectable passed HIV to their HIV -
negative sex partner  
● Advise patients that they can share the following personal information with current or 
potential sex partners:  
o When they last had a viral load test and if their viral load was undetectable  
● Individuals should tell their partner(s) that their HIV is undetectable only if they have 
taken HIV medicines consistently since their last test with an undetectable viral loadtaken HIV medicines consistently since their last test with an undetectable viral load  
5.1.5 Counselling patients about other preven tion combination interventions  
● PrEP:  PrEP is a safe and effective daily pill that prevents HIV infection. The partner without 
HIV may decide to take PrEP if they:  
o Are unsure that their partner’s HIV viral load is undetectable, especially if their 
partner has only recently started ART  
o Have mo re than 1 sexual partner  
o Feel more secure with the added perception of protection provided by PrEP  
● PEP:  After a possible HIV exposure (e.g., Occupational exposure or if a sex partner with HIV 
has not consistently taken ART and is not virally suppressed), t he immediate initiation of 
emergency PEP can prevent HIV infectionemergency PEP can prevent HIV infection  
● Condom use:  Condoms protect against other STIs, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and 
syphilis, and help prevent pregnancy.  
Counsel patients to find a prevention strategy that works for them:  
● If an individual who does not have HIV is unsure if their partner has an undetectable level of 
virus or is anxious about acquiring HIV, care providers should encourage that person to 
choose a prevention strategy that works for them, whether that is use of P rEP, emergency 
PEP, condoms, or a combination of these strategies  
Note: Care providers should emphasize that no one should ever be compelled to have 
sex without condoms  
5.1.6 Application of U=U in other settingssex without condoms  
5.1.6 Application of U=U in other settings  
● Breastfeeding:  Studies demonstrate that ART greatly reduces the risk of transmission 
through breast milk. However, research has not established that people whose HIV is 
undetectable do not transmit virus during breastfeeding. Prophylaxis should be provided 
to HIV expose d infants during the breastfeeding period as per the guidelines regardless 
of the viral load status  
● Injection drug use:  Studies demonstrate that ART greatly reduces the risk of 
transmission through sharing of injection drug use. However, research has not 
established that people whose HIV is undetectable do not transmit virus through needle 
sharing. All people who inject drugs should only use their own needles and not sharesharing. All people who inject drugs should only use their own needles and not share 
needles or other paraphernalia with others  
● Needle stick injuries:  Research has not es tablished that people with undetectable viral 
load do not transmit HIV to people who are stuck by needles containing their blood. HIV 
PEP should be provided as per the guidelinesv 4.7 Nutritional Services  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .........  36

Conduct a detailed systemic examination:  
• Emphasis should be placed on the system(s) which are primarily affected (Table 3.1)  
 
Investigations  
• All patients with advanced HIV disease should be screened for common OIs including TB, 
cryptococcal meningitis and other common OIs depending of their presenting signs and 
symptoms  
. 
Diagnosis of IRIS  
● IRIS should be suspected any time a patient has clinical deterioration weeks to months after 
starting ART (or switching to a suppressive ART regimen)  
● Clinical deterioration usually occurs within 4 -8 weeks of initiation or change of ART (but can be 
months afterwards)months afterwards)  
● IRIS has varied clinical presentations due to multiple possible pathogens that the immune system 
may be reacting to, and various immune system reactions; there are generally clinical 
manifestations consistent with an inflammatory condition  
● A high level of suspicion is required when making a diagnosis of IRIS, which is generally one of 
exclusion  
● Rule out the possibility of drug reaction, patient non -adherence to OI treatment, persistently active 
infection and/or drug resistance to OI treatment  
● There could be localized tissue inflammation with or without systemic inflammatory response

Men can be offered the two dosing options: daily oral PrEP or Event driven PrEP.  
• Daily dosing is appropriate for those whose occurrence of sex cannot be predicted and for 
those whose potential exposures to HIV  are more frequent than 2 times per week, such 
that ED -PrEP would be taken so frequently that it would effectively resemble daily PrEP.  
• If sex continues beyond one day, a user of ED -PrEP can stay protected by taking another 
pill each day as long as sex co ntinues and stopping 2 days after the last sex act.  
• On the other hand, if an individual starts daily oral PrEP, but then sex becomes infrequent 
and predictable, ED -PrEP can be used instead.and predictable, ED -PrEP can be used instead.

Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)  
The recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred 
and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables  6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis 
are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.  
All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents 
less than 15 years must have correct weight -based dosing of ARVs conf irmed at every visit.  
Infants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers shouldInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should 
be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including 
addressing anticipated challenges such as dr ug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one 
caregiver to be informed about a child’s HIV status and receive instruction on administration of 
ART.  
Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and 
administer ARVs.  This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) 
and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying 
a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day -to-day ART a dministration.Table 6.2: Preferred First -line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and

3 Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of 
previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as 
these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 
10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000,

Adults  
• Give 1 L of normal saline with 20 mmol of KCl over 2 -4 hours before each controlled 
infusion of Ampho B given with 1 litre of 5% dextrose. Add one to two tablets of 8 mEq 
KCl orally twice daily. An additional one 8 mEq KCl tablets twice daily may be added in 
the second week. Include magnesium supplementation at 250 mg tablets of magnesium 
trisilicate twice daily (or 4 mEq tablets of magnesium chloride t wice daily)  
Adolescents and Children  
• Give 1 L of normal saline with 20 mmol of KCl over 2 -4 hours before each controlled 
infusion of Ampho B. Darrows or Ringer’s solutions can also be usedinfusion of Ampho B. Darrows or Ringer’s solutions can also be used  
Note: Avoid KCl replacement in patients with pre -existing renal imp airment or 
hyperkalemia  
 
Managing hypokalaemia and raised creatinine levels  
• Obtain a routine baseline and twice weekly potassium and creatinine:  
- If K < 3.3 mmol/L, administer 1 L of normal saline with KCl 40 mmol in normal saline 
or 1 -2 tablets of 8mEq KCl every 8 hours. Add magnesium. Monitor potassium daily  
- If creatinine level increases > 2 -fold from baseline, omit dose of Ampho B, increase 
hydration to 1 L every 8 hours. If there’s improvement, re -start Ampho B at 0.7 
mg/kg/day on alternate days. If n o improvement, discontinue Ampho B, give 
fluconazole 1,600 mg/day to complete induction. Monitor creatinine dailyfluconazole 1,600 mg/day to complete induction. Monitor creatinine daily  
Therapeutic lumbar punctures are a critical component of the management of CM and 
should be standard of care:  
• For all patients with symptomati c CM: perform daily therapeutic lumbar punctures:  
- If opening pressure is ≤ 40 cm: draw off enough CSF to reduce pressure to 20 cm  
- If opening pressure is > 40 cm: draw off enough CSF to reduce pressure by 50%  
- Continue daily LPs until pressure is normal for 3 consecutive days  
- Restart LPs if symptoms return  
If measuring intracranial pressure is not possible (even using a giving set and tape measure), 
then perform daily therapeutic LPs until severe headache subsides, removing 10 -20 ml of CSF

5 - 5 5.1 Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U)  
ART adherence resulting to durable viral suppression eliminates risk of sexual transmission of 
HIV and is key to HIV epidemic control. Adoption of the Undetectable equals Untransmittable 
(U=U) campaign is posed to revolutionize HIV treatment among PLHIV and fortify treatment -for-
prevention strategies. Multiple studies have showed that durable viral suppression of <50 
copies/ml eliminates risk of sexual transmission of HIV. (Table 5. 17 Viral load cut -offs)  
The framework of U=U offers a unique opportunity to dismantle HIV stigma and discrimination, 
emphasizes the critical importance of antiretroviral therapy (ART), daily adherence, andemphasizes the critical importance of antiretroviral therapy (ART), daily adherence, and 
continuous engagement in medical care for  PLHIV.  
Definitions:  
● Durably Undetectable: 2 consecutive viral load results of <50 copies/ml  
● Untransmittable: The finding established by various clinical trials and observational 
studies, that people who maintain an undetectable viral load have minimal HIV virus in their 
blood and other body fluids secretions that they have “effectively no risk” of passing HIV to 
others through sex.  
5.1.1 Benefits of U=U  
● Diminish stigma associated with having HIV  
● Reduce barriers to HIV testing and treatment  
● Incre ase interest in starting and staying on ART  
● Improve self -esteem by removing the fear of being contagious● Improve self -esteem by removing the fear of being contagious  
● Support healthy sexuality regardless of HIV status  
● Reduce sex partners’ concerns  
5.1.2 Considerations for implementation of U=U within clinical setting s 
● Viral load monitoring as per the recommended intervals for various populations  
● Continuous adherence monitoring and support at all clinical visits  
● STI screening at all visits  
● Messaging on U=U should be provided for all PLHIV as part of treatment literacy  
5.1.3 Messaging to Patients on U=U  
● Keeping your HIV undetectable helps you live a long and healthy life  
● To get your HIV to an undetectable level and to keep it undetectable, take antiretroviral 
medicines as prescribedmedicines as prescribed  
● It may take up to 6 months o f taking HIV treatment medicines to bring your HIV viral load 
down to an undetectable level  
● If you are durably suppressed and you are taking your medications as prescribed, you can 
be sure you will not pass HIV through sex  
● People who keep their HIV at an undetectable level will not pass HIV to others through sex  
● If you stop taking HIV medicines, your HIV can rebound to a detectable level within 1 to 2 
weeks, and you may pass HIV to your sex partners  
● Keeping your HIV at durably suppressed level helps you sa fely conceive a child with your 
partnerKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022  
 
13 - 56 Annex 16: Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome  
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)  
Definition:  
IRIS is a paradoxical inflammatory reaction against a foreign antigen (alive or dead) in patients who 
have started ART with reconstitution (improved functioning) of their immune system. The immune 
system, once it regains some function, is now able to respond against the foreign antigen.  
Classification:  
● Unmasked IRIS: appearance of a previously undiagnosed opportunistic infection (OI) following 
ART initiation (or switch of ART to a suppressive regimen)  
● Paradoxical IRIS: worsening of a previously diagnosed disease after ART initiation (or switch of 
ART to a suppressive regimen)ART to a suppressive regimen)  
Risk Factors for IRIS:  
● 10-20% of patients who start ART with advanced immunosuppression (refer to Chapter 3) 
experience clinical deterioration during the first few months due to IRIS  
● High risk patients include:  
o Advanced immunosuppression (WHO Stage 3 or 4, or CD4 count ≤ 200 cell/mm3 ( or CD4% ≤ 
25% for children ≤ 5 years old))  
o Patients with a diagnosed opportunistic infection like TB, MAC, CMV, and PCP  
o Low baseline CD4 (CD4 count ≤ 50 cell/mm3 or CD4% ≤ 10%)  
o High baseline viral load  
o Substantial increase in CD4 count and drop in viral load after starting ART  
Patient evaluation:  
In addition to the clinical evaluation for PLHIV outlined in Table 3.1, emphasis should be placed on thefollowing areas during the patient evaluation:  
History:  
Symptoms and current ARV history:  
• Specific systemic symptomatology  
• Date of ARV initiation  
• Regimen  
• Reason for substitution / switch from previous ART if not first line  
• Adherence to ART and other ongoing treatment  
• HIV viral load  
• CD4 count  
Prior History:  
• ARV toxicity  
• Drug -drug interaction  
• CD4 count  
• HIV viral load  History of treatment of opportunistic infections:  
• Date of initiation of treatment  
• Duration of therapy  
• Clinical response to treatment  
• Adherence to the OI treatment  
• Any default to treatment  
• Resistance to treatmentKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Figure 11.3 Schema for Event -Driven PrEP  
When is ED -PrEP considered most appropriate?  
Event driven PrEP is most appropriate for men who:  
• Have infrequent sex (for example, sex less than 2 times per week on average).  
• Can plan for sex at least 2 hours in advance or who can delay sex for at least 2 hours.  
• Would find ED -PrEP more convenient  
Clients on Event driven PrEP require follow up. Figure 11.4  shows the schema for follow up of 
event driven PrEP.  
Assess HIV risk and determine eligibility for oral PrEP
Offer PrEP and discuss dosing options.
Daily dosing if risk is more frequent 
than 2 times per week and sex cannot 
be predicted or delayed by 2 hours.Men who have sex with men on PrEPbe predicted or delayed by 2 hours.Men who have sex with men on PrEP 
can switch from daily dosing to ED -
PrEP (and vice -versa)Event -driven dosing if sex can be 
predicted (particularly for infrequent 
sex)
Follow -up visit (1 month after initiation and/or every 3 months) 
✓ Provide HIV testing and screen for STIs
✓ Offer counselling by discussing adherence dosing strategy during use, and if PrEP user 
transitions from one dosing strategy to another. 
✓ Assess if HIV risk is likely to persist in the next few weeks and months. 
✓ May require more active support in continuing PrEP, whichever dosing strategy is chosen.

5 - 4 Persons living positively (adolescent and adult peer educators who can share personal 
experiences when needed) should be engaged to support patient education as indicated in the 
operational guidance below.  
Operational Guidance: Meaningful Involvement of People Living with HIV  
For best patient outcomes, PLHIV themselves should be engaged to lead facility -based and 
community -based HIV ed ucation and support systems. They are often referred to as “peer 
educators”, “mentor mothers”, and “lay health workers” in these roles. PLHIV have successfully and 
significantly contributed to: improving identification of people at risk for HIV or infected  with HIV;increasing linkage from testing to treatment; reducing onward transmission of HIV; providing 
psychosocial support, and improving adherence and retention to care and ART.  
 
Identifying PLHIV to offer peer -led patient support:  
● PLHIV on ART for ≥ 1  year  
● Good adherence and undetectable VL  
● Positive attitude and interest in supporting peers  
 
Preparing and supporting PLHIV to play a role in patient support systems:  
● Must be trained for the role they are expected to provide  
● Must have job aids and IEC material appropriate for their role  
● Must be supervised by healthcare professionals  
 
Potential roles for PLHIV include  
● Supporting HIV self -testing  
● Providing HIV testing services  
● Acting as peer linkage supporters● Providing HIV testing services  
● Acting as peer linkage supporters  
● Leading or contributing to facility -based or community -based support groups  
● Providing individual or group HIV education  
● Providing individual or group adherence counselling  
● Distribution of ART refills for stable patients  
 
Compensation for PLHIV who contribute to patient support systems  
● Recognition (e.g., ID badges; certificates of service; acknowledgement at community forums)  
● Training opportunities with certification  
● Financial compensation (e.g., salaries; stipends; transportation allowances)  
● Priority consideration for em ployment opportunitiesiii Table of Contents

11.3.2 EVENT DRIVEN PrEP (ON DEMAND PrEP or 2+1+1 PrEP)  
What is event driven?  
An “Event” refers to a sexual act. Event driven PrEP is where oral PrEP is to be used when an  
isolated sexual act is anticipated.isolated sexual act is anticipated.   
Event -Driven PrEP is recommended for all people assigned male at birth not taking exogenous

6. Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, 
Adolescents, and Adults  
ART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is 
to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the  patient’s VL to undetectable levels. 
Uninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels 
thereby preventing damage to the body’s immune system, reducing AIDS -related morbidity and 
mortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.  
6.1 Eligibility for ART  
All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 
count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co -infection status, 
risk group, or any other cri teria.  
6.2 Timing of ART Initiation  
ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of 
confirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.  
ART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be 
addressed around the time of ART initiation. Same -day ART initiation (on the same day as testing 
HIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfee dingHIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfee ding 
women, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with 
improved retention, viral suppression, and survival. Special considerations for timing of ART 
initiation are listed in Table 6.1.Standard Package of Care for PLHIV  
4 - 11  4.3.2 Tuberculosis (TB) Prevention and Management for PLHIV  
All PLHIV should be screened for TB at every visit using the Intensified Case Finding (ICF) tool.  
All PLHIV older than 12 months of age who screen negative for TB should be provided with TB 
Preventive Therapy (TPT) unless they have a s pecific contraindication.  All patients who receive 
a full course of TPT should have this clearly documented in their file (Section 8.2)  
For PLHIV who have presumptive TB, GeneXpert ultra is the preferred testing platform to 
confirm the diagnosis, with TB -LAM used as an adjunct bedside test when indicated, while 
awaiting GeneXpert ultra -results. All PLHIV qualify for ART, including patients with HIV/TB co -
infection.infection.  
Chapter 8 provides specific guidelines for ICF, TPT, use of GeneXpert ultra and TB -LAM, and ART 
for patients with TB/HIV co -infection.  
4.3.3 Cryptococcal Meningitis (CM) Screening and Treatment  
All adult and adolescent PLHIV with a baseline CD4 count of ≤ 200 cells/mm3   should be 
screened for cryptococcal infection (Figure 4.1). This should be a  reflex test performed by the 
laboratory as soon as the low CD4 count is noted, rather than requiring the clinician to order a 
special test for screening.  
PLHIV, including children and adolescents, should receive cryptococcal screening if clinically 
suspec ted. For patients who are symptomatic for meningitis but screen serum CrAg negative,suspec ted. For patients who are symptomatic for meningitis but screen serum CrAg negative, 
alternative diagnoses for sub -acute meningitis should be explored, such as TB meningitis. All 
patients with clinical meningitis should be assessed and managed at a facilit y that can perform 
lumbar punctures.  
Whenever performing CSF CrAg for patients with symptomatic meningitis, CSF GeneXpert 
ultra for TB should be performed at the same time, as well as urine for TB -LAM . 
Fluconazole use during first trimester of pregnancy in creases the risk of birth defects. All 
pregnant women who screen positive with serum CrAg should be offered a lumbar puncture 
(irrespective of symptoms) to determine if they have cryptococcal meningitis. If the CSF CrAg is(irrespective of symptoms) to determine if they have cryptococcal meningitis. If the CSF CrAg is 
positive, they should be treated with 2 weeks of amphotericin B for induction (without 
fluconazole), while consulting Uliza!  Hotline (0726 460 000; ulizanascop@gmail.com) to discuss 
consolidation/maintenance. Pregnant women with negative CSF CrAg should start ART 
immediately (without pre -emptive fluconazole therapy) and be monitored for symptoms of CM.  
Table 4. 7 provides detailed guidance on the use of amphotericin, fluconazole, flucytosine (once 
available), and therapeutic lumbar punctures for the treatment of symptomatic cryptococcal

5 - 3 Adherence is most difficult during the first few months of treatment: the patient is not yet in the 
habit of taking their medications every day, they are not familiar with common side -effects, and 
they have more challenges with disclosure and stigma,  all of which can interfere with adherence. 
Poor adherence within the first few months of therapy is also the most risky period for 
development of resistance mutations, when the viral load is still high.  
 
For these reasons, adherence preparation, monitorin g and support must be emphasized 
during the first few months of ART until the patient achieves full virological suppression,  
after which adherence monitoring and support can continue at lower intensity.after which adherence monitoring and support can continue at lower intensity.  
 
Patient preparation and counselling should be a coll aborative process between the provider and 
the patient or caregiver, to enable the patient to initiate and continue lifelong treatment. This is 
best done when the same adherence counsellor follows an individual patient throughout the 
preparation, initiatio n, and early ART period.  
 
ART can be initiated concurrently with the first adherence counselling session, even during 
the enrolment visit, especially for infants and for pregnant women. This may also apply to 
patients with a good understanding of HIV and A RT and strong motivation for immediate 
ART initiation.ART initiation.  
 
Each member of the multidisciplinary team should have the requisite training to provide 
treatment education and offer appropriate support to address potential barriers to adherence. 
Treatment preparat ion and support can be offered at triage, consultation, pharmacy or any other 
clinic station where confidentiality and privacy are assured and providers are adequately trained. 
It should also be incorporated into health talks, peer support group activities , and group 
counselling sessions.  
 
Before commencement of a counseling session, the counselor should ensure that adequate space is available 
to conduct the counseling, that confidentiality can be maintained, and that tools such as psychosocialassessment f orms, treatment literacy flip charts, PHDP flip charts, and tools to document the counseling 
sessions are available.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Dapsone as a Substitute for CPT  
In situations of severe allergy to cotrimoxazole or when desensitization is not successful, 
dapsone can be used instead of CTX. It is primarily effective as prophylaxis against PCP but does 
not have the other prophylactic benefits of cotrimoxazole.  
Note:  
Dapsone will contribute to anaemia in most patients, and causes haemolytic anaemia in some 
patients, so pati ents should have a baseline Hb before starting dapsone and Hb monitored every 
1-2 weeks for the first couple of months.1-2 weeks for the first couple of months.  
When dapsone (as a substitute for CPT) is being used as PCP prophylaxis, it is only 
recommended for patients in WHO Stage 4 and/or with  absolute CD4 count ≤ 200 
cells/mm3 (or CD4 % ≤ 25% for children ≤ 5 years old), and should be discontinued once 
a patient achieves a sustained CD4 count of > 200 cells/mm3 (or > 25% for children ≤ 5 
years old) for at least 6 months.  
Dapsone is NOT recomme nded during breastfeeding.

Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must 
have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action 
within 24 hours of a missed appointment (Figure 5.3).  
Enter date of next appointment/TCA for each patient into the 
appointment diary
• As patients arrive at the service delivery point their name should be 
checked off in the appointment diary for that day
• All patients who had appointments booked for the day but did not 
attend clinic should be recorded in the patient follow -up register
• Patient/caregiver should be called within 24 hours of missed 
appointment• Patient/caregiver should be called within 24 hours of missed 
appointment
• If no response, treatment buddy should be called
• Several attempts at phone tracing should be made if no response 
initially

is often a relatively mild maculopapular rash with or without pruritus. Infrequently, rash 
may develop with severe exfoliation of the skin and Stevens -Johnson syndrome. Rash 
severity should b e assessed, with management based on severity (Table 4.5)  
● Desensitization is effective in the majority of patients with mild to moderate rash (Table● Desensitization is effective in the majority of patients with mild to moderate rash (Table

8. TB/HIV Co -infection, Prevention and 
Management  
 
TB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this 
burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre -emptive and preventive  treatment 
for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in 
combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.  
All PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquir ing TB, strategies for reducing 
exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of 
transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.  
Healthcare settings present suitable conditions f or transmission of TB, particularly among 
vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB 
infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors 
and staff.  
8.1 TB Screenin g for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)  
TB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom -based 
TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; 
patients who screen pos itive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnosticpatients who screen pos itive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic 
pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for 
TB preventive therapy (TPT).  
Active Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screenin g among PLHIV, whereas 
Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go 
beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups 
that are underserved or at higher risk of  TB are actively reached for providing access to care, 
including screening and testingAdherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support  
5 - 1  
5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and 
Support  
 
The individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the 
prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow -up plans. Adherence -
enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV di agnosis (as part of 
post -test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the 
entire follow -up period for ART.  
 
To avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have 
an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individualan adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual 
barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. 
This is particularly important with the current recommendation t hat all PLHIV qualify for ART, 
and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at 
time of HIV testing, and close follow -up is required after ART initiation.  
 
The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to 
their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow -up stage that they are at (Figure 
5.1).  
 
Whenever possible, follow -up should be provided by the same care provider or team of careWhenever possible, follow -up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care 
providers (e.g ., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important 
during the first few months of HIV care.Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

● Emotional Barriers  
• Review the patient’s motivation:  
“How do you feel about taking drugs every day?” 
“What are your ambitions in life?”  
• You can use motivation cards for this: Ask the patient to think of his or her own personal 
goals/dreams for the future. What are the 3 most important things they  still want to achieve? 
Have them write them in their own words on a notecard. Encourage the patient to read the 
notecard every day, preferably right before they take their medication  
• Mental health screening:  
- Depression is an important reason of non -adherence.  All patients with suspected or 
confirmed treatment failure should be screened for depression using the PHQ -9 toolconfirmed treatment failure should be screened for depression using the PHQ -9 tool 
(Table 4.14)  
- The patient may be in any of the five stages of grief (because of their HIV diagnosis or for 
other reasons): deni al and isolation; anger; bargaining; depression, or; acceptance. This 
needs to be assessed and addressed  
Socio -economical Barriers  
• Review the patient’s disclosure of their HIV status  
“Do you have any people in your life who you can talk to about your HIV status and ART?”  
• Discuss how the patient can enlist the support of their family, friends, and/or co -workers in 
reminding them to take their medication if they have not already done so  
• Support from a treatment buddy: if the patient came with treatment buddy, assess their input• Support from a treatment buddy: if the patient came with treatment buddy, assess their input 
towards adherence. If patient did not come with treatment buddy, explain the role of a treatment 
buddy and encourage the patient to come with a person they trust next visit  
• Support in family/community/support group: expl ore support systems, in addition to the 
treatment buddy, that the patient is currently using and options that the patient can start using. 
Discuss the advantages of joining a support group and any reasons the patient is hesitant to join  
• Profession, income generating resources: review the patient’s and family’s sources of income 
and how well they cover their needs  
• Specific barriers to come to health centre on regular basis: ask the patient if they have any• Specific barriers to come to health centre on regular basis: ask the patient if they have any 
challenges getting to the clinic on regular basis. Help the patient develop strategies to overcome 
those challenges  
• Stigma and discrimination  
“Are you ever worried about people finding out your HIV status 
accidentally?” “Do you feel like people treat you differently when they know 
your HIV status?”  
• Discuss if stigma is making it difficult for them to take their medications on time, or for them 
to attend clinic appointments  
• Religious beliefs: find out if the patient has tried faith healing, or if they have ever stopped taking 
their medicine because of their religious beliefsKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022  
2 - 20  
Education/counselling  for patients who are on ART and present with a new negative HIV antibody test
• The new HIV antibody test may be a  false negative    the patient may still be HIV -infected but their antibody 
levels may be suppressed as a result of effective ART. This is more common for patients who start ART very 
soon after HIV infection
• Those with prior history of detectable viral loads, positive DNA PCR results, or low CD4 counts are almost 
always truly HIV positive
• Continue their ART until a special test is performed (a new sample for DNA PCR) at the National HIV 
Reference Laboratory (NHRL)
• Stopping ART before HIV status is confirmed could result in a rapid rise in viral load, decline in CD4, andincreased risk of developing an opportunistic infection or dying
• Draw a sample for DNA PCR  and send to the NHRL  (preferably a whole blood EDTA sample following 
cold -chain protocols within 24 hours of collection; DBS is acceptable if EDTA is not possible)
• Specify that this is a sample for confirming HIV status  of a patient who is on ART, and provide the dates 
and results for all prior antibody tests, DNA PCR tests, and RNA viral load tests in the request form
If HIV DNA PCR sample is positive
• This confirms the patient is HIV positive
• Provide additional counseling on the 
reasons why the antibody test may have 
been falsely negative and discourage the 
patient from any repeat antibody testing
• Emphasize that the patient  s ART is 
working and the need for continued• Emphasize that the patient  s ART is 
working and the need for continued 
excellent adherenceIf HIV DNA PCR sample is negative
• The patient may be HIV negative, or it could be that the 
patient is  HIV positive but the HIV DNA levels have been 
suppressed below the testing limit (this is more common if 
a DBS sample was used)
• Inform the patient that they may still be HIV positive and 
need to be monitored closely for an additional 6 months 
before confirming they are HIV negative
• Inform the patient that ART should be stopped immediately
• They should return for HIV viral load performed at 1 
month, 3 months, and 6 months after stopping ART 
(samples for HIV viral load should be sent to the designated 
VL/EID network laboratory assigned to the requestingVL/EID network laboratory assigned to the requesting 
facility with all past details)

4 - 42 4.8.2 Malaria  
Children and adults living with HIV suffer heavier parasitaemia and more malaria morbidity with 
advanced HIV disease. Further, people with advanced immunosuppression are at risk of failure 
of anti -malarial treatment. In pregnancy, there is increased risk of placental malaria,  severe 
anaemia, premature delivery and perinatal mortality. Drug interactions between ARVs and 
antimalarial drugs may further complicate management.  
Recommendations for malaria prevention for PLHIV include:  
● Offer cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) for  protection against malaria infection 
(Table 4. 3: Co-trimoxazole Preventive therapy)(Table 4. 3: Co-trimoxazole Preventive therapy)  
● In areas of stable malaria transmission, PLHIV should have access to insecticide treated 
mosquito nets (ITNs) or indoor residual spraying to reduce exposure to mosquito bi tes 
and therefore malaria transmission  
● PLHIV travelling from non -malarious zones to malaria endemic areas should sleep under 
ITNs  
● Pregnant women with HIV living in areas of stable malaria transmission who are not able 
to take CPT should be given at least t hree doses of sulfadoxine -pyrimethamine (SP) 
intermittent preventive treatment for malaria as part of routine antenatal care  
Note:  SP should not be given to women who are taking CPT  
● PLHIV on CPT who develop fever should not be treated for an unconfirmed presumptive● PLHIV on CPT who develop fever should not be treated for an unconfirmed presumptive 
diagnosis of malaria. Laboratory confirmation of malaria should be obtained prior to 
initiation of anti -malarial therapy  
● PLHIV with malaria should receive standard antimalarial therapy according to national 
guidelines.  Those on CPT should not be given sulfa -containing anti -malarial drugs. 
Patients on ART receiving anti -malarial therapy should be monitored closely for adverse 
drug reactions  
4.8.3 Safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  
Diarrheal illnesses are common causes of morbidity and  mortality among PLHIV. These diseases 
are often due to lack of access to safe drinking water, improper disposal of human and animalare often due to lack of access to safe drinking water, improper disposal of human and animal 
waste, and poor personal hygiene, leading to contamination of food and water.  
Recommendations for prevention of faecal -oral ly spread illnesses include:  
● Offer CPT for protection against some GI infections (Table 4.3: Co -trimoxazole 
Preventive therapy)  
● Hand washing with soap and water after handling human or animal faeces, after using 
the toilet, and before food preparation or eating  
● Facilities for proper disposal of human waste.  
● Training on household -based water treatment methods and water storage containers 
that prevent direct hand contact with drinking waterKenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022

Behavioural Barriers  
• Review how the patient takes drugs  
“Please explain how you take your drugs, and at what time?”  
“How does treatment fit in your daily routines?”  
• Establish with the patient whether the time they are meant to take their medication is 
appropriate or whether the time is a problem. For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, 
but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a 
problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their 
schedule  
• Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she 
remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should 
be taken at the usual timebe taken at the usual time  
“What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)” “What do you do in case of visits, and 
travel?”  
• Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient 
to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand  before and to remember to pack 
it 
• Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that 
if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go 
to the closest ART clinic and sho w their appointment card  
“What do you do in case of side effects?”  
• Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it 
difficult to take ARVsdifficult to take ARVs  
• Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he 
takes the drugs.  
“What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”  
• Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they 
sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do  
• “Taking alcohol or drugs sometimes makes it difficult for us to remember to take treatment. If 
possible, it is best to limit your use, but if you are planning to take any alcohol or drugs, it is 
important to plan ahead so that you don’t for get to take your treatment”  
“If you feel your alcohol or drug use is affecting your adherence, are you ready to be referred to someprofessionals that may help you work on that problem?”Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)  
11 - 3 HIV self -test (HIVST) should not be used as a de finitive HIV test for PrEP initiation and 
follow up monitoring.  
11.2 Package of PrEP Service  
PrEP should be offered as part of the comprehensive prevention package which includes 
behavioural, bio medical and structural components. Integration of PrEP serv ices is 
recommended within different service delivery points, including in the community, ANC and FP 
clinics.

Case 
management  • Assign a case manager to all children and adolescents (those not achieving 
optimum treatment outcomes); pregnant women, orphans, patients with alcohol 
and substance abuse, patients with mental illness, patients with suspected or 
confirmed treatment failure, and any patients who the healthcare team feels has 
poor adheren ce or is at high risk of defaulting from care  
• The case manager is the link between the patient and the MDT  
• Roles  of the case managers include:  
o Coordinating multidisciplinary management for patients under case 
managemento Coordinating multidisciplinary management for patients under case 
management  
o Following up on appointment -keeping for their patients  
o Organizing patient reminders (SMS, calling the day before) and other support 
systems  
o Ensuring appropriate defaulter tracing  
o Coordinating home visits to their patients  
Directly 
observed 
therapy  • Patients with suspected treatment failure should have DOTs to ensure good 
adherence before a viral load is repeated to confirm treatment failure  
• DOTs involve a healthcare provider, family member, treatment supporter or any 
trained peer observing the patient ingesting th eir prescribed ART on a daily basis  
• DOTs can be tapered off once the patient adopts consistent adherence -enhancing• DOTs can be tapered off once the patient adopts consistent adherence -enhancing 
behaviours  and barriers to adherence are overcome  
Home visits  • Observe where and how a patient stores and takes their medications, and assess if 
they have extra medications because of missed doses  
• Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation 
and specific barriers to adherence  
• Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if 
the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment  
or initiation)  
Monthly “high 
viral load” 
clinics  • Patients with suspected treatment failure should be booked for dedicated monthly 
high viral load clinicshigh viral load clinics  
• Children and adolescents in school who are unable to attend clinic monthly may 
attend dedicated monthly clinics during mid -term and school holidays (at least 
every 6 weeks)  
• Comprehensive clinical and psychosocial evaluation should be conducted at e ach 
visit, appropriate investigations done and any opportunistic infections treated  
• Enhanced adherence counseling sessions should be conducted at each visit  
• Support groups for patients with viremia can be timed with “high viral load” clinic 
days  
Special 
support 
groups  • For health facilities with several patients who are failing treatment or who are on 
2nd line ART, special support groups can be established so these patients can work 
through their adherence challenges togetherthrough their adherence challenges together  
• Community support groups can also be engaged and linked to the facility for 
supporting patients with adherence challengesStandard Package of Care for PLHIV

Listen  Listen to the client closely, with empathy and without judging  
Inquire  Assess and respond to the client’s various needs and concerns  
Validate  Show the client that you understand and believe them. Assure the client that they 
are not to blame  
Enhance safety  Discuss a plan to protect the client from further harm if violence occurs again  
Support  Support the client by helping them to access information, services and social 
support  
Supportive messages that may be helpful include:  
● “What happened to you is not your fault”  
● “Many women/men are in the same situation as you”  
● “You are not to blame.”● “Many women/men are in the same situation as you”  
● “You are not to blame.”  
● “Everybody deserves to feel safe at home if you feel like you are in immediate danger, we can 
involve the police or local administration “  
Men, the  elderly, and children suffer different forms of violence and should be assessed if there 
is any clinical suspicion. Key populations are particularly vulnerable to abuse, including MSM, 
transgender, and prisoners. For children art and play therapy is used during history taking and 
psychological assessment.  
4.2.2 HIV Education/Counselling  
All PLHIV and caregivers should receive focused education about HIV and its treatment to 
empower them to succeed in management of the infection. Self -management is critica l to theempower them to succeed in management of the infection. Self -management is critica l to the 
successful treatment of any chronic illness, including HIV. Key messages for HIV education and 
adherence counselling are described in Chapter 5 of these guidelines.  
In addition, psychosocial counselling and support for PLHIV and caregivers should include:  
● Mitigation of fear, anger, self -stigma and discrimination  
● Alleviation of grief, bewilderment and stress among partners and family members  
● Behavior changes in support of healthy living and prevention of further HIV transmission  
● Skills -building on how to live a healthy and productive life  
● Identification and treatment of depression and substance abuse● Identification and treatment of depression and substance abuse  
HIV education and counselling can be offered in multiple settings, including: facility -based 
individual, couples, family, and/or gro up counselling, and through community -based counselling 
and peer support groups.Standard Package of Care for PLHIV  
4 - 41 PLHIV may have an inadequate response to immunizations, particularly before they achieve full 
viral suppression. The ideal timing, dose, and frequency of re -immunizations for children on ART
